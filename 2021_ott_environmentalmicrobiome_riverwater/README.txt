Dr. Ott and Dr. Graham are no longer at Newcastle and these were the comments I received in return email:

Dear Maxwell,

Amelie Ott left Newcastle University a number of years ago and I am not sure where the data are archived. I also am not at Newcastle anymore, except in an Emeritus role. I am now at Durham University.

With this background, I have cc:d Marcos Quintela-Baluja who worked with Amelie on the manuscript and is now a professor at Durham University. I am not sure whether Marcos can help. I also provide an email Amelie in her position in Brussels, but I am not sure what she will have access to data either. However, maybe.

Hopefully, they might be able to answer questions.

Good luck,
David Graham
