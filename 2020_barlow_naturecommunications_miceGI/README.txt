Microbial Load = dPCR concentration × elution volume × dead volume factor ÷ (extraction volume × sample mass )
Dead volume factor = volume recovered / total volume applied
​
Every sample that underwent dPCR had total microbial load measured. According to the experimental setup described​:
Stool samples were collected before the diet switch (Day 0), and after the switch at Day 4, Day 7, and Day 10.
GI tract samples (Stomach, Upper Small Intestine, Lower Small Intestine, Cecum, Colon, Mucosa) were collected on Day 10.
Each mouse had microbial load measured in stool and GI sites.
They had 12 mice total (6 ketogenic diet, 6 control diet).
Therefore, microbial load was measured in:
All stool samples (4 timepoints × 12 mice = 48 stool samples)
Multiple GI sites at necropsy (Day 10 samples), for mucosal and lumenal samples.

Experimental setup:
12 mice total (6 ketogenic diet, 6 control diet)

Timepoints:

Day 0 — stool only (before diet switch)
Day 4 — stool only
Day 7 — stool only
Day 10 — stool and GI tract (euthanized on Day 10)

Sample Types:
Stool (Day 0, 4, 7, 10)

GI sites collected at necropsy (Day 10 only):
Stomach contents (lumen)
Upper small intestine contents (lumen)
Upper small intestine mucosa (scraping)
Lower small intestine contents (lumen)
Lower small intestine mucosa (scraping)
Cecum contents (lumen)
Colon mucosa (scraping)

Note: Colon mucosa only (they didn't collect colon lumen separately), and stool counts as terminal colon contents.

Stool samples:
4 timepoints × 12 mice = 48 stool samples

GI tract samples at Day 10:
Each mouse provides:

Stomach lumen
Upper SI lumen
Upper SI mucosa
Lower SI lumen
Lower SI mucosa
Cecum lumen
Colon mucosa

→ 7 GI site samples per mouse

Thus:
7 × 12 = 84 GI samples from euthanized mice

Total samples:
48 (stool) + 84 (GI Day 10) = 132 samples total

Each sample would have a unique name, generally like:
M1P_D0_Stool
M1P_D10_Stomach_Lumen
M1P_D10_UpperSI_Lumen
M1P_D10_UpperSI_Mucosa
M1P_D10_LowerSI_Lumen
M1P_D10_LowerSI_Mucosa
M1P_D10_Cecum_Lumen
M1P_D10_Colon_Mucosa
etc.

where:

M1P = Mouse 1, control diet
M1NP = Mouse 1, ketogenic diet

(P vs NP probably meaning something like Positive/Negative for Keto in their naming.)

So to summarize:

Item	Count
Stool (Day 0, 4, 7, 10)	48 samples
GI Tract (Stomach, SI, Cecum, Colon, Mucosa, Day 10)	84 samples
Total samples	132 samples
