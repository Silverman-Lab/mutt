Bovine fecal samples (heifers):
Subjects: 8 heifers.
Samples: 3 pooled samples (BP1, BP2, BP3), with each pool further split into:
High Biomass (HBM): 3 subsamples per pool → 
3×3=9 subsamples.
Low Biomass (LBM): 3 subsamples per pool → 
3×3=9 subsamples.

Total samples from bovine feces: 
9+9=18.

Rhizosphere soil:
Subjects: Single soil sample.
Samples: 9 technical replicates.

Ground beetles (Carabidae spp.):
Subjects: 3 individuals.
Samples: 3 technical replicates per individual → 
3×3=9.

Earthworms (Lumbricus spp.):
Subjects: 3 individuals.
Samples: 3 technical replicates per individual → 
3×3=9.

Springtails (Collembola):
Subjects: Pool of 6 individuals.
Samples: 6 technical replicates.

Roundworms (Nematoda spp.):
Subjects: 9 pools (30 individuals per pool).
Samples: 9 technical replicates.

Red deer (Cervus elaphus) fecal pellets:
Subjects: 3 fecal pellets.
Samples: 3 technical replicates per pellet → 
3×3=9.

European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) fecal pellets:
Subjects: 2 fecal pellets.

Total: 30 Subjects
	75 Samples
