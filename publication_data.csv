29143816,Vandeputte 2017,Quantitative microbiome profiling links gut community variation to microbial load.,"Doris Vandeputte, Gunter Kathagen, Kevin D'hoe, Sara Vieira-Silva, Mireia Valles-Colomer, João Sabino, Jun Wang, Raul Y Tito, Lindsey De Commer, Youssef Darzi, Séverine Vermeire, Gwen Falony, Jeroen Raes",,2017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29143816/,Flow Cytometry,16S,"Current sequencing-based analyses of faecal microbiota quantify microbial taxa and metabolic pathways as fractions of the sample sequence library generated by each analysis. Although these relative approaches permit detection of disease-associated microbiome variation, they are limited in their ability to reveal the interplay between microbiota and host health. Comparative analyses of relative microbiome data cannot provide information about the extent or directionality of changes in taxa abundance or metabolic potential. If microbial load varies substantially between samples, relative profiling will hamper attempts to link microbiome features to quantitative data such as physiological parameters or metabolite concentrations. Saliently, relative approaches ignore the possibility that altered overall microbiota abundance itself could be a key identifier of a disease-associated ecosystem configuration. To enable genuine characterization of host-microbiota interactions, microbiome research must exchange ratios for counts. Here we build a workflow for the quantitative microbiome profiling of faecal material, through parallelization of amplicon sequencing and flow cytometric enumeration of microbial cells. We observe up to tenfold differences in the microbial loads of healthy individuals and relate this variation to enterotype differentiation. We show how microbial abundances underpin both microbiota variation between individuals and covariation with host phenotype. Quantitative profiling bypasses compositionality effects in the reconstruction of gut microbiota interaction networks and reveals that the taxonomic trade-off between Bacteroides and Prevotella is an artefact of relative microbiome analyses. Finally, we identify microbial load as a key driver of observed microbiota alterations in a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease, here associated with a low-cell-count Bacteroides enterotype (as defined through relative profiling).",Nature,551,7681,507-511,10.1038/nature24460,,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Age Factors; Aging; Bacterial Load; Cohort Studies; Colony Count, Microbial; Crohn Disease; Feces; Flow Cytometry; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Microbiota; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Research Group of Microbiology, Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Research Group of Microbiology, Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Research Group of Microbiology, Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; VIB, Center for Microbiology, Kasteelpark Arenberg 31, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",,2025-03-25

While they have opened up new possibilities for studying microbial communities, they also have one drawback, namely providing only relative abundances and thus compositional data. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used for years for the quantification of bacteria. However, this method requires the development of specific primers and has a low throughput. The constraint of low throughput has recently been overcome by the development of high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR), which allows for the simultaneous detection of the most prevalent bacteria in moderately complex systems, such as cheese and other fermented dairy foods. In the present study, the performance of the two approaches, NGS and HT-qPCR, was compared by analyzing the same DNA samples from 21 Raclette du Valais protected designation of origin (PDO) cheeses. Based on the results obtained, the differences, accuracy, and usefulness of the two approaches were studied in detail. The results obtained using NGS (non-targeted) and HT-qPCR (targeted) show considerable agreement in determining the microbial composition of the cheese DNA samples studied, albeit the fundamentally different nature of these two approaches. A few inconsistencies in species detection were observed, particularly for less abundant ones. The detailed comparison of the results for 15 bacterial species/groups measured by both methods revealed a considerable bias for certain bacterial species in the measurements of the amplicon sequencing approach. We identified as probable origin to this PCR bias due to primer mismatches, variations in the number of copies for the 16S rRNA gene, and bias introduced in the bioinformatics analysis. As the normalized microbial composition results of NGS and HT-qPCR agreed for most of the 21 cheese samples analyzed, both methods can be considered as complementary and reliable for studying the microbial composition of cheese. Their combined application proved to be very helpful in identifying potential biases and overcoming methodological limitations in the quantitative analysis of the cheese microbiota.",BMC microbiology,22,1,48,10.1186/s12866-022-02451-y,PMC8819918,Journal Article,"Bacteria; Cheese; Computational Biology; DNA, Bacterial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"Agroscope, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003, Bern, Switzerland. matthias.dreier@agroscope.admin.ch.; Laboratory of Microbiology, University of Neuchâtel, Emile-Argand 11, CH-2000, Neuchâtel, Switzerland. matthias.dreier@agroscope.admin.ch.; Agroscope, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Biomedicine, Applied Microbiology Research, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland.; Agroscope, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003, Bern, Switzerland.; Agroscope, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003, Bern, Switzerland.; Agroscope, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, CH-3003, Bern, Switzerland.; Laboratory of Microbiology, University of Neuchâtel, Emile-Argand 11, CH-2000, Neuchâtel, Switzerland.",,2025-03-25

However, metagenomic sequencing data sets provide researchers with only a snapshot of a dynamic ecosystem and do not provide information about the total microbial number, or load, of a sample. Additionally, DNA can be detected long after a microorganism is dead, making it unsafe to assume that all microbial sequences detected in a community came from living organisms. By combining relic DNA removal by propidium monoazide (PMA) with microbial quantification with flow cytometry, we present a novel workflow to quantify live microbial load in parallel with metagenomic sequencing. We applied this method to unstimulated saliva samples, which can easily be collected longitudinally and standardized by passive collection time. We found that the number of live microorganisms detected in saliva was inversely correlated with salivary flow rate and fluctuated by an order of magnitude throughout the day in healthy individuals. In an acute perturbation experiment, alcohol-free mouthwash resulted in a massive decrease in live bacteria, which would have been missed if we did not consider dead cell signal. While removing relic DNA from saliva samples did not greatly impact the microbial composition, it did increase our resolution among samples collected over time. These results provide novel insight into the dynamic nature of host-associated microbiomes and underline the importance of applying scale-invariant tools in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data sets.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Human microbiomes are dynamic ecosystems often composed of hundreds of unique microbial taxa. To detect fluctuations over time in the human oral microbiome, we developed a novel workflow to quantify live microbial cells with flow cytometry in parallel with next-generation sequencing, and applied this method to over 150 unstimulated, timed saliva samples. Microbial load was inversely correlated with salivary flow rate and fluctuated by an order of magnitude within a single participant throughout the day. Removing relic DNA improved our ability to distinguish samples over time and revealed that the percentage of sequenced bacteria in a given saliva sample that are alive can range from nearly 0% up to 100% throughout a typical day. These findings highlight the dynamic ecosystem of the human oral microbiome and the benefit of removing relic DNA signals in longitudinal microbiome study designs.",mSystems,6,1,,10.1128/mSystems.01182-20,PMC8561659,Journal Article,,16S sequencing; flow cytometry; longitudinal; microbial load; microbiome; propidium monoazide (PMA); relic DNA; saliva,"Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Center for Microbiome Innovation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA kzengler@ucsd.edu.; Center for Microbiome Innovation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.",,2025-03-25

We use the 16S rDNA read counts of the spike-in bacteria to adjust the read counts of endogenous bacteria for changes in total microbial loads. Using a series of dilutions of pooled faecal samples from mice containing defined amounts of the spike-in bacteria Salinibacter ruber, Rhizobium radiobacter and Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus, we demonstrate that spike-in-based calibration to microbial loads allows accurate estimation of ratios of absolute endogenous bacteria abundances.

Exogenous spike-in bacteria in gut microbiome studies enable estimation of ratios of absolute OTU abundances, providing novel insights into the structure and the dynamics of intestinal microbiomes.",Microbiome,4,1,28,10.1186/s40168-016-0175-0,PMC4915049,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals; Bacteria; Bacteriological Techniques; DNA, Ribosomal; Feces; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mice; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",16S rRNA gene sequencing; Bacterial communities; Community analysis; Microbial load; Microbiome profiling; Spike-in bacteria; Standardization,"Chair of Statistical Bioinformatics, University of Regensburg, Am BioPark 9, 93053, Regensburg, Germany.

Like in other arthropods, the microbiome may affect the tick's biology, with consequences for pathogen transmission. Here, we explored the bacterial communities of I. ricinus across its developmental stages and six geographic locations by the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, combined with quantification of the bacterial load. A wide range of bacterial loads was found. Accurate quantification of low microbial biomass samples permitted comparisons to high biomass samples, despite the presence of contaminating DNA. The bacterial communities of ticks were associated with geographical location rather than life stage, and differences in Rickettsia abundance determined this association. Subsequently, we explored the geographical distribution of four vertically transmitted symbionts identified in the microbiome analysis. For that, we screened 16,555 nymphs from 19 forest sites for R. helvetica, Rickettsiella spp., Midichloria mitochondrii, and Spiroplasma ixodetis. Also, the infection rates and distributions of these symbionts were compared to the horizontally transmitted pathogens Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Neoehrlichia mikurensis. The infection rates of all vertically transmitted symbionts differed between the study sites, and none of the symbionts was present in all tested ticks suggesting a facultative association with I. ricinus. The proportions in which symbionts occurred in populations of I. ricinus were highly variable, but geographically close study sites expressed similar proportions. These patterns were in contrast to what we observed for horizontally transmitted pathogens. Lastly, nearly 12% of tested nymphs were free of any targeted microorganisms, which is in line with the microbiome analyses. Our results show that the microbiome of I. ricinus is highly variable, but changes gradually and ticks originating from geographically close forest sites express similar bacterial communities. This suggests that geography-related factors affect the infection rates of vertically transmitted symbionts in I. ricinus. Since some symbionts, such as R. helvetica can cause disease in humans, we propose that public health investigations consider geographical differences in its infection rates.",Microbiome,10,1,120,10.1186/s40168-022-01276-1,PMC9351266,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Anaplasma phagocytophilum; Animals; Humans; Ixodes; Nymph; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rickettsia",Low-biomass samples; Quantitative microbiome analysis; Spotted fever rickettsiosis; Tick-borne disease; Transmission dynamics,"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, Bilthoven, 3720 MA, the Netherlands. aleksandra.i.krawczyk@gmail.com.; Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands. aleksandra.i.krawczyk@gmail.com.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium.; Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, Bilthoven, 3720 MA, the Netherlands.; Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, Bilthoven, 3720 MA, the Netherlands.; Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium.; Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, Bilthoven, 3720 MA, the Netherlands. hsprong@gmail.com.",,2025-03-25

Among several mechanisms involved in its aetiopathogenesis, recent studies have also postulated the involvement of the vaginal and intestinal microbiota in the development of this disorder. In this study, an accurate insight into the microbial changes associated with PCOS was performed through a pooled-analysis highlighting that this syndrome is characterized by intestinal and vaginal dysbiosis with a reduction of beneficial microorganisms and a higher proportion of potential pathogens. Based on this observation, we evaluated the ability of a milk-derived protein exerting positive outcomes in the management of PCOS, that is, α-lactalbumin (α-LA), to recover PCOS-related dysbiosis. In vitro experiments revealed that this protein improved the growth performances of members of two health-promoting bacterial genera, that is, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, depleted in both intestinal and vaginal microbiota of PCOS-affected women. In addition, α-LA modulated the taxonomic composition and growth performances of the microbial players of the complex intestinal and vaginal microbiota. Finally, an in vivo pilot study further corroborated these observations. The oral administration of α-LA for 30 days to women with PCOS revealed that this protein may have a role in favouring the growth of health-promoting bacteria yet limiting the proliferation of potential pathogens. Overall, our results could pave the way to the use of α-LA as a valid compound with 'prebiotic effects' to limit/restore the PCOS-related intestinal and vaginal dysbiosis.",Microbial biotechnology,17,10,e14540,10.1111/1751-7915.14540,PMC11450379,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Lactalbumin; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Female; Vagina; Humans; Dysbiosis; Adult; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Microbiota; Bacteria; Young Adult,,"Laboratory of Probiogenomics, Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Microbiome Research Hub, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Laboratory of Probiogenomics, Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; R&D Department, Lo.Li Pharma, Rome, Italy.; R&D Department, Lo.Li Pharma, Rome, Italy.; A.G.UN.Co.

There is increasing evidence that measurement of the total count and concentration of microbes in the gut, or 'absolute abundance', provides a richer source of information than relative abundance and can correct some conclusions drawn from relative abundance data. However, little is known about how preservative choice can affect these measurements. In this study, we investigated how two common preservatives and short-term storage conditions impact relative and absolute microbial measurements. OMNIgene GUT OMR-200 yields lower metagenomic taxonomic variation between different storage temperatures, whereas Zymo DNA/RNA Shield yields lower metatranscriptomic taxonomic variation. Absolute abundance quantification reveals two different causes of variable Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratios across preservatives.

Bact2 is characterized by a high proportion of Bacteroides, a low proportion of Faecalibacterium and low microbial cell densities<sup>1,2</sup>, and its prevalence varies from 13% in a general population cohort to as high as 78% in patients with inflammatory bowel disease<sup>2</sup>. Reported changes in stool consistency<sup>3</sup> and inflammation status<sup>4</sup> during the progression towards obesity and metabolic comorbidities led us to propose that these developments might similarly correlate with an increased prevalence of the potentially dysbiotic Bact2 enterotype. Here, by exploring obesity-associated microbiota alterations in the quantitative faecal metagenomes of the cross-sectional MetaCardis Body Mass Index Spectrum cohort (n = 888), we identify statin therapy as a key covariate of microbiome diversification. By focusing on a subcohort of participants that are not medicated with statins, we find that the prevalence of Bact2 correlates with body mass index, increasing from 3.90% in lean or overweight participants to 17.73% in obese participants. Systemic inflammation levels in Bact2-enterotyped individuals are higher than predicted on the basis of their obesity status, indicative of Bact2 as a dysbiotic microbiome constellation. We also observe that obesity-associated microbiota dysbiosis is negatively associated with statin treatment, resulting in a lower Bact2 prevalence of 5.88% in statin-medicated obese participants. This finding is validated in both the accompanying MetaCardis cardiovascular disease dataset (n = 282) and the independent Flemish Gut Flora Project population cohort (n = 2,345).

Here, through integrated multi-omics analyses of 2,173 European residents from the MetaCardis cohort, we show that the explanatory power of drugs for the variability in both host and gut microbiome features exceeds that of disease. We quantify inferred effects of single medications, their combinations as well as additive effects, and show that the latter shift the metabolome and microbiome towards a healthier state, exemplified in synergistic reduction in serum atherogenic lipoproteins by statins combined with aspirin, or enrichment of intestinal Roseburia by diuretic agents combined with beta-blockers. Several antibiotics exhibit a quantitative relationship between the number of courses prescribed and progression towards a microbiome state that is associated with the severity of cardiometabolic disease. We also report a relationship between cardiometabolic drug dosage, improvement in clinical markers and microbiome composition, supporting direct drug effects. Taken together, our computational framework and resulting resources enable the disentanglement of the effects of drugs and disease on host and microbiome features in multimedicated individuals.

We recruited 1,241 middle-aged Europeans, including healthy individuals, individuals with dysmetabolic morbidities (obesity and type 2 diabetes) but lacking overt IHD diagnosis and individuals with IHD at three distinct clinical stages-acute coronary syndrome, chronic IHD and IHD with heart failure-and characterized their phenome, gut metagenome and serum and urine metabolome. We found that about 75% of microbiome and metabolome features that distinguish individuals with IHD from healthy individuals after adjustment for effects of medication and lifestyle are present in individuals exhibiting dysmetabolism, suggesting that major alterations of the gut microbiome and metabolome might begin long before clinical onset of IHD. We further categorized microbiome and metabolome signatures related to prodromal dysmetabolism, specific to IHD in general or to each of its three subtypes or related to escalation or de-escalation of IHD. Discriminant analysis based on specific IHD microbiome and metabolome features could better differentiate individuals with IHD from healthy individuals or metabolically matched individuals as compared to the conventional risk markers, pointing to a pathophysiological relevance of these features.",Nature medicine,28,2,303-314,10.1038/s41591-022-01688-4,PMC8863577,"Journal Article;

We evaluated 2 elastography techniques for diagnosis of alcoholic fibrosis and cirrhosis; liver biopsy with Ishak score and collagen-proportionate area were used as reference. We performed a prospective study of 199 consecutive patients with ongoing or prior alcohol abuse, but without known liver disease. One group of patients had a high pretest probability of cirrhosis because they were identified at hospital liver clinics (in Southern Denmark). The second, lower-risk group, was recruited from municipal alcohol rehabilitation centers and the Danish national public health portal. All subjects underwent same-day transient elastography (FibroScan), 2-dimensional shear wave elastography (Supersonic Aixplorer), and liver biopsy after an overnight fast. Transient elastography and 2-dimensional shear wave elastography identified subjects in each group with significant fibrosis (Ishak score ≥3) and cirrhosis (Ishak score ≥5) with high accuracy (area under the curve ≥0.92). There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy between techniques. The cutoff values for optimal identification of significant fibrosis by transient elastography and 2-dimensional shear wave elastography were 9.6 kPa and 10.2 kPa, and for cirrhosis 19.7 kPa and 16.4 kPa. Negative predictive values were high for both groups, but the positive predictive value for cirrhosis was >66% in the high-risk group vs approximately 50% in the low-risk group. Evidence of alcohol-induced damage to cholangiocytes, but not ongoing alcohol abuse, affected liver stiffness. The collagen-proportionate area correlated with Ishak grades and accurately identified individuals with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.

We compared the accuracy of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test (ELF), the FibroTest, liver stiffness measurements (made by transient elastography and 2-dimensional shear-wave elastography), and 6 indirect marker tests in detection of advanced liver fibrosis (Kleiner stage ≥F3). We performed a prospective study of 10 liver fibrosis markers (patented and not), all performed on the same day. Patients were recruited from primary centers (municipal alcohol rehabilitation, n = 128; 6% with advanced fibrosis) and secondary health care centers (hospital outpatient clinics, n = 161; 36% with advanced fibrosis) in the Region of Southern Denmark from 2013 through 2016. Biopsy-verified fibrosis stage was used as the reference standard. The primary aim was to validate ELF in detection of advanced fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease recruited from primary and secondary health care centers, using the literature-based cutoff value of 10.5. Secondary aims were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ELF for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis and to determine whether combinations of fibrosis markers increase diagnostic yield. The ELF identified patients with advanced liver fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89-0.96); findings did not differ significantly between patients from primary vs secondary care (P = .917). ELF more accurately identified patients with advanced liver fibrosis than indirect marker tests, but ELF and FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracies (AUROC of FibroTest, 0.90) (P = .209 for comparison with ELF). Results from the ELF and FibroTest did not differ significantly from those of liver stiffness measurement in intention-to-diagnose analyses (AUROC for transient elastography, 0.90), but did differ in the per-protocol analysis (AUROC for transient elastography, 0.97) (P = .521 and .004 for comparison with ELF). Adding a serum marker to transient elastography analysis did not increase accuracy. For patients in primary care, ELF values below 10.5 and FibroTest values below 0.58 had negative predictive values for advanced liver fibrosis of 98% and 94%, respectively.

We therefore aimed to assess and compare the prognostic performance of elastography and blood-based markers to predict time to the first liver-related event, severe infection, and all-cause mortality in patients with a history of excess drinking. We performed a prospective cohort study in patients with early, compensated alcohol-related liver disease. At baseline, we obtained a liver biopsy, transient elastography (TE), 2-dimensional shear-wave elastography (2D-SWE), enhanced liver fibrosis test (ELF), FibroTest, fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), non-alcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score (NFS) and Forns index. We compared C-statistics and time-dependent AUC for prognostication. We used validated cut-off points to create 3 risk groups for each test: low, intermediate and high risk. We followed 462 patients for a median of 49 months (IQR 31-70). Median age was 57 years, 76% were males, 20% had advanced fibrosis. Eighty-four patients (18%) developed a liver-related event after a median of 18 months (7-34). TE had the highest prognostic accuracy, with a C-statistic of 0.876, and time-dependent AUC at 5 years of 0.889, comparable to 2D-SWE and ELF. TE, ELF and 2D-SWE outperformed FibroTest, FIB4, NFS, Forns index and biopsy-verified fibrosis stage. Compared to patients with TE <10 kPa, the hazard ratios for liver-related events for TE 10-15 kPa were 8.1 (3.2-20.4), and 27.9 (13.8-56.8) for TE >15 kPa. Periods of excessive drinking during follow-up increased the risk of progressing to liver-related events, except for patients in the low-risk groups. TE, ELF and 2D-SWE are highly accurate prognostic markers in patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Easy-to-use cut-offs can distinguish between substantially different risk profiles. Alcohol is the leading cause of death and illness due to liver disease. In this study, we assessed the ability of biomarkers to predict the risk of developing symptomatic liver disease in patients with early stages of alcohol-related liver disease. We found that several tests accurately predicted the risk of liver-related events such as ascites, esophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy during an average follow-up of 4.1 years.

Abstinence from alcohol remains the cornerstone of alcoholic liver disease treatment; however, this approach is hampered by frequent relapse and lack of specific therapy for treating advanced cases of liver disease. In the present study, we hypothesized that gut microbiota drive the development of liver fibrosis and that modulation of gut microbiota with the gut-selective, nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin attenuates alcoholic liver fibrosis. Our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will include 136 participants with biopsy-verified alcoholic fibrosis (Ishak liver fibrosis score of 1-4). Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or 550 mg of rifaximin twice daily for 18 months. A liver biopsy will be performed at the end of the treatment period to evaluate the effect of drug treatment on liver fibrosis. Stool, urine, and saliva specimens will be collected before treatment begins, at 1 month, and at the end of the treatment period. Fecal samples are used for microbiome deep sequencing. Changes in microbiome composition are compared before and after the trial medication period and linked to changes in liver fibrosis. This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the effect of gut microbiota on liver fibrosis in humans.

GALA-RIF was an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, phase 2 trial done at Odense University Hospital in Denmark. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18-75 years) who had current or previous alcohol overuse (at least 1 year with ≥24 g of alcohol per day for women and ≥36 g of alcohol per day for men), biopsy-proven alcohol-related liver disease, and no previous hepatic decompensation. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) through a web-based randomisation system to receive oral rifaximin-α (550 mg) twice daily or matched placebo for 18 months. Randomisation was done in blocks of four and stratified according to fibrosis stage and alcohol abstinence. Participants, sponsor, investigators, and nurses involved in the study were masked to the randomisation outcome. The primary endpoint was a histological decrease from baseline to 18-month treatment of at least one fibrosis stage, according to the Kleiner fibrosis score. We also assessed the number of patients with progression by at least one fibrosis stage from baseline to 18 months. Primary analyses were done in the per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations; safety was assessed in the full intention-to-treat population. The per-protocol population was defined as all randomly assigned patients who did not present serious protocol violations, who ingested at least 75% of the treatment, and who were not withdrawn from the study due to non-adherence (interruption of treatment for 4 weeks or more). Participants receiving at least one dose of the intervention were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. This completed trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2014-001856-51.

Here we study human hepatic lipid turnover during controlled alcohol intoxication. We studied 39 participants with 3 distinct hepatic phenotypes: alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and healthy controls. Alcohol was administrated via nasogastric tube over 30 min. Hepatic and systemic venous blood was sampled simultaneously at 3 time points: baseline, 60, and 180 min after alcohol intervention. Liver biopsies were sampled 240 min after alcohol intervention. We used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to measure levels of more than 250 lipid species from the blood and liver samples. After alcohol intervention, the levels of blood free fatty acid (FFA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) decreased, while triglyceride (TG) increased. FFA was the only lipid class to decrease in NAFLD after alcohol intervention, whereas LPC and FFA decreased and TG increased after intervention in ALD and healthy controls. Fatty acid chain uptake preference in FFAs and LPCs were oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Hepatic venous blood FFA and LPC levels were lower when compared with systemic venous blood levels throughout the intervention. After alcohol intoxication, liver lipidome in ALD was similar to that in NAFLD. Alcohol intoxication induces rapid changes in circulating lipids including hepatic turnaround from FFA and LPC, potentially leading to lipoapoptosis and steatohepatitis. TG clearance was suppressed in NAFLD, possibly explaining why alcohol and NAFLD are synergistic risk factors for disease progression. These effects may be central to the pathogenesis of ALD. The study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03018990). We report that alcohol induces hepatic extraction of free unsaturated fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholines, hepatotoxic lipids which have not been previously associated with alcohol-induced liver injury. We also found that individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have reduced lipid turnover during alcohol intoxication when compared with people with alcohol-related fatty liver disease. This may explain why alcohol is particularly more harmful in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver and why elevated BMI and alcohol have a synergistic effect on the risk of liver-related death.",JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,3,5,100325,10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100325,PMC8350545,Journal Article,,"ALD, alcohol-related liver disease; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, asparagine aminotransferase; Alcohol; CTL, healthy control; Cer, ceramide; DG, diglyceride; Ethanol; FFA, free fatty acid; Fatty acids; GGT, gamma-glutamyl transferase; HOMA-IR, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance; Heavy drinking; HexCer, hexosylceramide; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LacCer, lactosylceramides; Lipidomics; Liver disease; Lysophosphatidylcholines; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; P-glucose, plasma glucose; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PLA2, phospholipase A2; QC, quality control; SHexCer, sulfatides hexosylceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; TE, transient elastography; TG, triglyceride; Triglycerides","Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; OPEN Open Patient data Explorative Network, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Gentofte, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Gentofte, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.; Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Gentofte, Denmark.; King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.",,2025-03-25

Thirty-eight participants (13 with ArLD, 15 with NAFLD and 10 healthy controls) received 2.5 mL of 40% ethanol per kg body weight via a nasogastric tube. Seventy-two inflammation-related markers were quantified in plasma from hepatic and systemic venous blood, at baseline, 60 and 180 min after intervention. Alcohol intervention altered the levels of 31 of 72 and 14 of 72 markers in the systemic and hepatic circulation. All changes observed in the hepatic circulation were also identified in the systemic circulation after 180 min. Only FGF21 and IL6 were increased after alcohol intervention, while the remaining 29 markers decreased. Differences in response to acute alcohol between the groups were observed for 8 markers, and FGF21 response was blunted in individuals with steatosis. Acute alcohol intoxication induced changes in multiple inflammation-related markers, implicated in alcohol metabolism and hepatocellular damage. Differences identified between marker response to binge drinking in ArLD, NAFLD and healthy controls may provide important clues to disease mechanisms and potential targets for treatment.

The present study analysed CysC and BTP to evaluate their prognostic value and differentiate them according to sex. CysC and BTP were measured in 173 transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)-patients from the NEPTUN-STUDY(NCT03628807) and analysed their relationship with mortality and sex. Propensity score for age, MELD, etiology and TIPS indication was used. Cystatin C and BTP showed excellent correlations with creatinine values at baseline and follow-up. CysC was an independent predictor of overall mortality (HR = 1.66(1.33-2.06)) with an AUC of 0.75 and identified a cut-off of 1.55 mg/L in the whole cohort. Interestingly, CysC was significantly lower in females, also after propensity score matching. In males, the only independent predictor was the creatinine level (HR = 1.54(1.25-1.58)), while in females CysC levels independently predicted mortality (HR = 3.17(1.34-7.52)). This study demonstrates for the first time that in TIPS-patients creatinine predicts mortality in males better than in females, whereas CysC is a better predictor of mortality in females. These results may influence future clinical decisions on therapeutic options for example, allocation for liver transplantation in TIPS-patients.",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,40,1,186-193,10.1111/liv.14230,,"Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Creatinine; Cystatin C; Female; Germany; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Intramolecular Oxidoreductases; Kidney Diseases; Lipocalins; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",beta-trace protein; cirrhosis; cystatin C; portal hypertension; renal function,"European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Gastroenterology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.; Liver ICU, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic y Provencial de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Translational Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Clinic Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.; European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure, Barcelona, Spain.; Translational Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Clinic Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.; Translational Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Clinic Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure, Barcelona, Spain.; Liver ICU, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic y Provencial de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.; Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.",,2025-03-25

The aim of this study was to identify blood-circulating miRNAs associated with cirrhosis progression and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Using high-throughput screening of 754 miRNAs, serum samples from 45 patients with compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, or ACLF were compared with those from healthy individuals (n = 15). miRNA levels were correlated with clinical parameters, organ failure, and disease progression and outcome. Dysregulated miRNAs were evaluated in portal and hepatic vein samples (n = 33), liver tissues (n = 17), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 16). miRNA screening analysis revealed that circulating miRNAs are dysregulated in cirrhosis progression, with 51 miRNAs being differentially expressed among all groups of patients. Unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis indicated that the main differences in miRNA expression occurred at decompensation, showing similar levels in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and those with ACLF. Of 43 selected miRNAs examined for differences among groups, 10 were differentially expressed according to disease progression. Moreover, 20 circulating miRNAs were correlated with model for end-stage liver disease and Child-Pugh scores. Notably, 11 dysregulated miRNAs were associated with kidney or liver failure, encephalopathy, bacterial infection, and poor outcomes. The most severely dysregulated miRNAs (<i>i.e.</i> miR-146a-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-191-5p) were further evaluated in portal and hepatic vein blood and liver tissue, but showed no differences. However, PBMCs from patients with cirrhosis showed significant downregulation of miR-26 and miR-146a, suggesting a extrahepatic origin of some circulating miRNAs. This study is a repository of circulating miRNA data following cirrhosis progression and ACLF. Circulating miRNAs were profoundly dysregulated during the progression of chronic liver disease, were associated with failure of several organs and could have prognostic utility. Circulating miRNAs are small molecules in the blood that can be used to identify or predict a clinical condition. Our study aimed to identify miRNAs for use as biomarkers in patients with cirrhosis or acute-on-chronic liver failure.

We hypothesised that serum concentrations of MIF are associated with disease severity and outcome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Circulating concentrations of MIF and its soluble receptor CD74 (sCD74) were determined in sera from 292 patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis defined as new onset or worsening of ascites requiring hospitalisation. Of those, 78 (27%) had ACLF. Short-term mortality was assessed 90 days after inclusion. Although serum concentrations of MIF and sCD74 did not correlate with liver function parameters or ACLF, higher MIF (optimum cut-off >2.3 ng/ml) and lower concentrations of sCD74 (optimum cut-off <66.5 ng/ml) both indicated poorer 90-day transplant-free survival in univariate analyses (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.01 [1.26-3.22]; <i>p</i> = 0.004 for MIF; HR 0.59 [0.38-0.92]; <i>p</i> = 0.02 for sCD74) and after adjustment in multivariable models. Higher MIF concentrations correlated with surrogates of systemic inflammation (white blood cells, <i>p</i> = 0.005; C-reactive protein, <i>p</i> = 0.05) and were independent of genetic MIF promoter polymorphisms. Assessment of MIF plasma concentrations in portal venous blood and matched blood samples from the right atrium in a second cohort of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion revealed a transhepatic MIF gradient with higher concentrations in the right atrial blood. Serum concentrations of MIF and its soluble receptor CD74 predict 90-day transplant-free survival in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis. This effect was independent of liver function and genetic predispositions, but rather reflected systemic inflammation. Therefore, MIF and sCD74 represent promising prognostic markers beyond classical scoring systems in patients at risk of ACLF. Inflammatory processes contribute to the increased risk of death in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. We show that patients with high serum levels of the inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) alongside low levels of its binding receptor sCD74 in blood indicate an increased mortality risk in patients with ascites.

We showed that chicken gut microbiota abundance and diversity reached a plateau at 7 days posthatch (DPH), forming segment-specific community types after 1 DPH. The bacteriome was more impacted by deterministic processes, and the mycobiome was more affected by stochastic processes. We also observed stage-specific microbes in different gut segments, and three microbial occurrence patterns including ""colonization,"" ""disappearance,"" and ""core"" were defined. The microbial co-occurrence networks were very different among gut segments, with more positive associations than negative associations. Furthermore, we provided links between the absolute changes in chicken gut microbiota and their serum metabolite variations. Time-course untargeted metabolomics revealed six metabolite clusters with different changing patterns of abundance. The foregut microbiota had more connections with chicken serum metabolites, and the gut microbes were closely related to chicken lipid and amino acid metabolism.

The gut microbiota influences methionine metabolism, potentially impacting sulfur metabolite dysfunctions in CKD. We evaluated whether gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to H<sub>2</sub>S and lanthionine metabolic alterations in CKD. The gut microbiota of 88 CKD patients (non-dialysis, hemodialysis, and transplant patients) and 26 healthy controls were profiled using 16 S-amplicon sequencing. H<sub>2</sub>S and lanthionine concentrations were measured in serum and fecal samples using the methylene blue method and LC-MS/MS, respectively. The CKD population exhibited a tenfold increase in serum lanthionine associated with kidney dysfunction. Despite lanthionine retention, hemodialysis and transplant patients had significantly lower serum H<sub>2</sub>S than healthy controls. Fecal H<sub>2</sub>S levels were not altered or related to bloodstream H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations. Conversely, fecal lanthionine was significantly increased in CKD compared to healthy controls and associated with kidney dysfunction. Microbiota composition varied among CKD groups and healthy controls, with the greatest dissimilarity observed between hemodialysis and transplant patients. Changes relative to the healthy group included uneven Ruminococcus gnavus distribution (higher in transplant patients and lower in non-dialysis CKD patients), reduced abundance of the short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria Alistipes indistinctus and Coprococcus eutactus among transplant patients, and depleted Streptococcus salivarius in non-dialysis CKD patients. A higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii, Christensenella minuta, and Negativibacillus massiliensis differentiated hemodialysis patients from controls. No correlation was found between differentially abundant species and the metabolic profile that could account for the H<sub>2</sub>S and lanthionine alterations observed. The metabolic deregulation of H<sub>2</sub>S and lanthionine observed in the study was not associated with alterations in the gut microbiota composition in CKD patients.

This study firstly identified the potential effect of aerobic and anaerobic fecal sample collection and transport materials on microbiota and quantitative microbiota in healthy and fat-metabolic disorder Thai adults aged 23-43 years. We employed metagenomics followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 16S rRNA gene qPCR, to analyze taxonomic composition, alpha diversity, beta diversity, bacterial quantification, Pearson's correlation with clinical factors for fat-metabolic disorder, and the microbial community and species potential metabolic functions. Our study successfully obtained microbiota results in percent and quantitative compositions. Each sample exhibited quality sequences with a >99% Good's coverage index, and a relatively plateau rarefaction curve. Alpha diversity indices showed no statistical difference in percent and quantitative microbiota OTU richness and evenness, between aerobic and anaerobic sample transport materials. Obligate and facultative anaerobic species were analyzed and no statistical difference was observed. Supportively, the beta diversity analysis by non-metric multidimensional scale (NMDS) constructed using various beta diversity coefficients showed resembling microbiota community structures between aerobic and anaerobic sample transport groups (<i>P</i> = 0.86). On the other hand, the beta diversity could distinguish microbiota community structures between healthy and fat-metabolic disorder groups (<i>P</i> = 0.02), along with Pearson's correlated clinical parameters (<i>i.e</i>., age, liver stiffness, GGT, BMI, and TC), the significantly associated bacterial species and their microbial metabolic functions. For example, genera such as <i>Ruminococcus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in healthy human gut provide functions in metabolisms of cofactors and vitamins, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites against gut pathogens, energy metabolisms, digestive system, and carbohydrate metabolism. These microbial functional characteristics were also predicted as healthy individual biomarkers by LEfSe scores. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that aerobic sample collection and transport (<48 h) did not statistically affect the microbiota and quantitative microbiota analyses in alpha and beta diversity measurements. The study also showed that the short-term aerobic sample collection and transport still allowed fecal microbiota differentiation between healthy and fat-metabolic disorder subjects, similar to anaerobic sample collection and transport. The core microbiota were analyzed, and the findings were consistent. Moreover, the microbiota-related metabolic potentials and bacterial species biomarkers in healthy and fat-metabolic disorder were suggested with statistical bioinformatics (<i>i.e</i>., <i>Bacteroides plebeius</i>).",PeerJ,12,,e17270,10.7717/peerj.17270,PMC11034497,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans; Adult; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Feces; Thailand; Male; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Female; Young Adult; Specimen Handling; Anaerobiosis; Aerobiosis; Metagenomics; Southeast Asian People",16S rRNA gene sequencing; Aerobic and anaerobic sample transport; Bacteria diversity; Fat-metabolic disease; Fecal; Human gut microbiome; Microbiota,"Program in Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Center of Excellence in Preventive and Integrative Medicine (CE-PIM) and Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Center of Excellence in Preventive and Integrative Medicine (CE-PIM) and Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Microbiome Research Unit for Probiotics in Food and Cosmetics, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Omics Sciences and Bioinformatics Center, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.; Multi-Omics for Functional Products in Food, Cosmetics and Animals Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.",,2025-03-25

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) can quantify individual species, but it is not practical to develop a suite of qPCR assays for every bacterium present in a diverse sample. We sought to determine the accuracy of an inferred measure of bacterial concentration using total bacterial load and relative abundance. We analyzed 1,320 samples from 20 women with a history of frequent bacterial vaginosis who self-collected vaginal swabs daily over 60 days. We inferred bacterial concentrations by taking the product of species relative abundance (assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and bacterial load (measured by broad-range 16S rRNA gene qPCR). Log<sub>10</sub>-converted inferred concentrations correlated with targeted qPCR (<i>r</i> = 0. 935, <i>P</i> < 2.2e-16) for seven key bacterial species. The mean inferred concentration error varied across bacteria, with rarer bacteria associated with larger errors. A total of 92% of the >0.5-log<sub>10</sub> errors occurred when the relative abundance was <10%. Many errors occurred during early bacterial expansion from or late contraction to low abundance. When the relative abundance of a species is >10%, inferred concentrations are reliable proxies for targeted qPCR in the vaginal microbiome. However, targeted qPCR is required to capture bacteria at low relative abundance and is preferable for characterizing growth and decay kinetics of single species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbiome studies primarily use 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in a community. However, these measurements do not accurately reflect absolute taxon concentrations. We sought to determine whether the product of species' relative abundance and total bacterial load measured by broad-range qPCR is an accurate proxy for individual species' concentrations, as measured by taxon-specific qPCR assays. Overall, the inferred bacterial concentrations were a reasonable proxy of species-specific qPCR values, particularly when bacteria are present at a higher relative abundance.

The foreskin is a major site of viral entry in heterosexual transmission of HIV. Although the probability of acquiring HIV from a sexual encounter is low, the risk varies even after adjusting for known HIV risk factors. The genital microbiome may account for some of the variability in risk by interacting with the host immune system to trigger inflammatory responses that mediate the infection of mucosal immune cells. We conducted a case-control study of uncircumcised participants nested within a randomized-controlled trial of male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. Using penile (coronal sulcus) swabs collected by study personnel at trial enrollment, we characterized the penile microbiome by sequencing and real-time PCR and cytokine levels by electrochemiluminescence assays. The absolute abundances of penile anaerobes at enrollment were associated with later risk of HIV seroconversion, with a 10-fold increase in <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, <i>Finegoldia</i>, and <i>Peptoniphilus</i> increasing the odds of HIV acquisition by 54 to 63%, after controlling for other known HIV risk factors. Increased abundances of anaerobic bacteria were also correlated with increased cytokines, including interleukin-8, which can trigger an inflammatory response that recruits susceptible immune cells, suggesting a mechanism underlying the increased risk. These same anaerobic genera can be shared between heterosexual partners and are associated with increased HIV acquisition in women, pointing to anaerobic dysbiosis in the genital microbiome and an accompanying inflammatory response as a novel, independent, and transmissible risk factor for HIV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> We found that uncircumcised men who became infected by HIV during a 2-year clinical trial had higher levels of penile anaerobes than uncircumcised men who remained HIV negative. We also found that having higher levels of penile anaerobes was also associated with higher production of immune factors that recruit HIV target cells to the foreskin, suggesting that anaerobes may modify HIV risk by triggering inflammation. These anaerobes are known to be shared by heterosexual partners and are associated with HIV risk in women. Therefore, penile anaerobes may be a sexually transmissible risk factor for HIV, and modifying the penile microbiome could potentially reduce HIV acquisition in both men and women.",mBio,8,4,,10.1128/mBio.00996-17,PMC5527312,Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,"Adolescent; Adult; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Case-Control Studies; Circumcision, Male; Dysbiosis; Female; Foreskin; HIV Infections; HIV Seropositivity; Heterosexuality; Humans; Interleukin-8; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged; Mucous Membrane; Penis; Prevotella; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Uganda; Young Adult",anaerobes; cytokines; foreskin inflammation; human immunodeficiency virus; penile microbiome; susceptibility,"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA cindyliu@gwu.edu.; Center for Microbiomics and Human Health, Division of Pathogen Genomics, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Ecosystem Science and Society, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.; Center for Microbiomics and Human Health, Division of Pathogen Genomics, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Entebbe, Uganda.; Center for Microbiomics and Human Health, Division of Pathogen Genomics, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.; Center for Microbiomics and Human Health, Division of Pathogen Genomics, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.",,2025-03-25

However, the onset of dysbiosis remains controversial and the involvement of host factors remains elusive. This study investigates the alterations of the seminal microbiome in male infertility and examines the association and function of DEFB119, a reproductive-tract-specific host antimicrobial peptide, on the seminal microbiome and male fertility. While we observed comparable genera, diversity and evenness of bacterial communities, a marked decrease in the modularity of the metacommunities was observed in patients with abnormal spermiogram (<i>n</i> = 57) as compared to the control (<i>n</i> = 30). A marked elevation of DEFB119 was observed in a subpopulation of male infertile patients (<i>n</i> = 5). Elevated seminal DEFB119 was associated with a decrease in the observed genera, diversity and evenness of bacterial communities, and further distortion of the metacommunities. Mediation analysis suggests the involvement of elevated DEFB119 and dysbiosis of the seminal microbiome in mediating the abnormalities in the spermiogram. Functional experiments showed that recombinant DEFB119 significantly decrease the progressive motility of sperm in patients with abnormal spermiogram. Moreover, DEFB119 demonstrated species-specific antimicrobial activity against common seminal and nonseminal species.

However, most of the currently available amplicon sequencing approaches are limited, as they result in relative abundance profiles of microbial taxa, which does not represent actual abundance in the environment. Here, we combined amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria and ITS region for fungi) with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to characterize the rhizosphere microbiome of wheat. We show that changes in the relative abundance of major microbial phyla do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the estimated quantitative abundance. Most of the bacterial phyla linked with the rhizosphere of plants grown in soil with no history of water stress showed enrichment patterns in their estimated absolute abundance, which was in contradiction with the trends observed in the relative abundance data. However, in the case of the fungal groups (except for <i>Basidiomycota</i>), such an enrichment pattern was not observed and the abundance of fungi remained relatively unchanged under different soil water stress history when estimated absolute abundance was considered. Comparing relative and estimated absolute abundances of dominant bacterial and fungal phyla, as well as their correlation with the functional processes in the rhizosphere, our results suggest that the estimated absolute abundance approach gives a different and more realistic perspective than the relative abundance approach.

Most of these studies rely on relative abundance measurements to drive conclusions. Inherent limitations of relative values are the inability to determine whether an individual taxon is more or less abundant and the magnitude of this change between the two samples. These limitations can be overcome by using absolute abundance quantifications, which can allow for a more complete understanding of community dynamics by measuring variations in total microbial loads. Obtaining absolute abundance measurements is still technically challenging. Here, we developed synthetic DNA (synDNA) spike-ins that enable precise and cost-effective absolute quantification of microbiome data by adding defined amounts of synDNAs to the samples. We designed 10 synDNAs with the following features: 2,000-bp length, variable GC content (26, 36, 46, 56, or 66% GC), and negligible identity to sequences found in the NCBI database. Dilution pools were generated by mixing the 10 synDNAs at different concentrations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing showed that the pools of synDNAs with different percentages of GC efficiently reproduced the serial dilution, showing high correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.96; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.94) and significance (<i>P</i> <<i> </i>0.01). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the synDNAs can be used as DNA spike-ins to generate linear models and predict with high accuracy the absolute number of bacterial cells in complex microbial communities. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The synDNAs designed in this study enable accurate and reproducible measurements of absolute amount and fold changes of bacterial species in complex microbial communities. The method proposed here is versatile and promising as it can be applied to bacterial communities or genomic features like genes and operons, in addition to being easily adaptable by other research groups at a low cost.

Currently, short-read platforms are commonly employed for high-throughput applications of SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing, but at the cost of poor taxonomic classification due to limited fragment lengths.

The consensus sequences generated with ssUMI were used to produce error-free de novo sequence features with no false positives with two microbial community standards.

We show that the root-associated bacteria exhibit strong succession during plant development, and bacterial loads largely increase at later stages, particularly for Bacteroidetes. Unbalanced fertilization has a significant effect on the assembly of the soybean rhizosphere bacteria, and in the absence of N fertilizer the bacterial community diverges from that of fertilized plants, while lacking P fertilizer impedes the total load and turnover of rhizosphere bacteria. Importantly, a SynCom derived from the low-nitrogen-enriched cluster is capable of stimulating plant growth, corresponding with the stabilized soybean productivity in the absence of N fertilizer.

At ambient temperature, SCFA and compositional profiles were stable for 24 h and 48 h, respectively, while at 4 °C, SCFA profiles were maintained for 48 h. The global metabolome was highly susceptible, already changing at 24 h in non-frozen conditions. Thus, faecal microbiota was best preserved on all levels when transported as a native sample frozen within 24 h, leading to the least biased outcomes in the analysis.

However, relative abundance does not reflect the quantity of the microbial community and the inter-sample differences among taxa. In this study, we refined and applied an integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) method to better characterize soil quantitative bacterial community through combining the relative abundance (by high-throughput sequencing) and total bacterial quantities (by quantitative PCR). The proposed iHAAQ method was validated by an internal reference strain EDL933 and a laboratory strain WG5. Application of the iHAAQ method to a soil phenanthrene biodegradation study showed that for some bacterial taxa, the changes of relative and absolute abundances were coincident, while for others the changes were opposite. With the addition of a microbial activity inhibitor (NaN<sub>3</sub>), the absolute abundances of soil bacterial taxa, including several dominant genera of <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Flavobacterium</i>, and <i>Paenibacillus</i>, decreased significantly, but their relative abundances increased after 28 days of incubation.

Here, we present a method to retrieve the concentrations of the 16S rRNA gene per gram of any environmental sample using a synthetic standard in minuscule amounts (100 ppm to 1% of the 16S rRNA sequences) that is added to the sample before DNA extraction and quantified by two quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) reactions. This allows normalizing by the initial microbial density, taking into account the DNA recovery yield. We quantified the internal standard and the total load of 16S rRNA genes by qPCR. The qPCR for the latter uses the exact same primers as those used for Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene to increase accuracy. We are able to calculate the absolute concentration of the species per gram of sample, taking into account the DNA recovery yield. This is crucial for an accurate estimate as the yield varied between 40% and 84%. This method avoids sacrificing a high proportion of the sequencing effort to quantify the internal standard. If sacrificing a part of the sequencing effort to the internal standard is acceptable, we however recommend that the internal standard accounts for 30% of the environmental 16S rRNA genes to avoid the PCR bias associated with rare phylotypes.

Anti-dsDNA (an important lupus autoantibody) and proteinuria developed as early as 6 months old in both models, with higher levels in FcGRIIb deficient (FcGRIIb-/-) mice. Compared to the healthy control at 2 and 4 months, the lupus mice (both FcGRRIIb-/- and pristane) and healthy mice at 6 months old demonstrated an alteration as indicated by the Shannon alpha diversity index, highlighting influences of lupus- and age-induced dysbiosis, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the fecal microbiota of FcGRIIb-/- mice were distinct from the age-matched healthy control at all timepoints (at 6 month, p < 0.05), while pristane mice showed divergence at only some timepoints. Analyses of different intestinal sections revealed similarity among microbiota in the cecum, colon, and feces, contrasting with those in the small intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). Subtle differences were found between FcGRIIb-/- and pristane mice in feces and the intestinal sections as assessed by several analyses, for examples, the similar or dissimilar distances (NMDS), the neighbor-joining clustering, and the potential metabolisms (KEGG pathway analysis). Due to the differences between the gut microbiota (feces and intestinal sections) in the lupus mice and the healthy control, rebalancing of the microbiota using rectal administration of feces from the healthy control (fecal transplantation; FMT) to 7-month-old FcGIIb-/- mice (the established lupus; positive anti-dsDNA and proteinuria) was performed. In comparison to FcGRIIb-/- mice without FMT, FMT mice (more effect on the female than the male mice) showed the lower anti-dsDNA levels with similar fecal microbiome diversity (16s DNA gene copy number) and microbiota patterns to the healthy control. In conclusion, gut microbiota (feces and intestinal sections) of lupus mice (FcGRIIb-/- and pristane) diverged from the control as early as 4-6 months old, correlating with lupus characteristics (anti-dsDNA and proteinuria). The different gut microbiota in FcGRIIb-/- and pristane suggested a possible different gut microbiota in lupus with various molecular causes.

Winter hive loss has significant negative impacts on agriculture, the economy, and ecosystems. Compared to other factors, the role of honey bee gut microbial communities in driving winter hive loss has received little attention. We investigate the relationship between winter survival and honey bee gut microbiome composition of 168 honey bees from 23 hives, nine of which failed to survive through winter 2022. We found that there was a substantial difference in the abundance and community composition of honey bee gut microbiomes based on hive condition, i.e., winter survival or failure. The overall microbial abundance, as assessed using Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP), was significantly greater in hives that survived winter 2022 than in those that failed, and the average overall abundance of each of ten bacterial genera was also greater in surviving hives. There were no significant differences in alpha diversity based on hive condition, but there was a highly significant difference in beta diversity. The bacterial genera Commensalibacter and Snodgrassella were positively associated with winter hive survival. Logistic regression and random forest machine learning models on pooled ASV counts for the genus data were highly predictive of winter outcome, although model performance decreased when samples from the location with no hive failures were excluded from analysis. As a whole, our results show that the abundance and community composition of honey bee gut microbiota is associated with winter hive loss, and can potentially be used as a diagnostic tool in evaluating hive health prior to the onset of winter.

To fully understand the function of bacterial microbiota, individual cells must be identified; however, it is difficult with current techniques. Here, we develop a method, Barcoding Bacteria for Identification and Quantification (BarBIQ), which classifies single bacterial cells into taxa-named herein cell-based operational taxonomy units (cOTUs)-based on cellularly barcoded 16S rRNA sequences with single-base accuracy, and quantifies the cell number for each cOTU in the microbiota in a high-throughput manner. We apply BarBIQ to murine cecal microbiotas and quantify in total 3.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> bacterial cells containing 810 cOTUs. Interestingly, we find location-dependent global differences in the cecal microbiota depending on the dietary vitamin A deficiency, and more differentially abundant cOTUs at the proximal location than the distal location. Importantly, these location differences are not clearly shown by conventional 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing methods, which quantify the 16S rRNA genes, not the cells.

Finished genome sequences were generated from Eubacterium rectale and E. eligens, which belong to Clostridium Cluster XIVa, one of the most common gut Firmicute clades. Comparison of these and 25 other gut Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes indicated that the Firmicutes possess smaller genomes and a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes.

B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to E. rectale by up-regulating expression of a variety of polysaccharide utilization loci encoding numerous glycoside hydrolases, and by signaling the host to produce mucosal glycans that it, but not E. rectale, can access. E. rectale adapts to B. thetaiotaomicron by decreasing production of its glycan-degrading enzymes, increasing expression of selected amino acid and sugar transporters, and facilitating glycolysis by reducing levels of NADH, in part via generation of butyrate from acetate, which in turn is used by the gut epithelium.

Gnotobiotic mice were colonized with an assemblage of sequenced human gut bacterial species with or without D. piger and fed diets with different levels and types of carbohydrates and sulfur sources. Diet was a major determinant of functions expressed by this artificial nine-member community and of the genes that impact D. piger fitness; the latter includes high- and low-affinity systems for using ammonia, a limiting resource for D. piger in mice consuming a polysaccharide-rich diet. Although genes involved in hydrogen consumption and sulfate reduction are necessary for its colonization, varying dietary-free sulfate levels did not significantly alter levels of D. piger, which can obtain sulfate from the host in part via cross-feeding mediated by Bacteroides-encoded sulfatases. Chondroitin sulfate, a common dietary supplement, increased D. piger and H2S levels without compromising gut barrier integrity. A chondroitin sulfate-supplemented diet together with D. piger impacted the assemblage's substrate utilization preferences, allowing consumption of more reduced carbon sources and increasing the abundance of the H2-producing Actinobacterium, Collinsella aerofaciens.

We investigated interactions between dietary ingredients, nutrients, and the microbiota in specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice given more than 40 unique diets; we quantified individual and synergistic effects of dietary macronutrients and the microbiota on intestinal health and development of colitis. C56BL/6J SPF and GF mice were placed on custom diets containing different concentrations and sources of protein, fat, digestible carbohydrates, and indigestible carbohydrates (fiber). After 1 week, SPF and GF mice were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was determined based on the percent weight change from baseline, and modeled as a function of the concentration of each macronutrient in the diet.

The compositional nature of such microbiome datasets makes it however challenging to identify those microbial taxa that are truly associated with an intervention or health outcome. Quantitative microbiome profiling overcomes the compositional structure of microbiome sequencing data by integrating absolute quantification of microbial abundances into the NGS data. Both cell-based methods (e.g., flow cytometry) and molecular methods (qPCR) have been used to determine the absolute microbial abundances, but to what extent different quantification methods generate similar quantitative microbiome profiles has so far not been explored. Here we compared relative microbiome profiling (without incorporation of microbial quantification) to three variations of quantitative microbiome profiling: (1) microbial cell counting using flow cytometry (QMP), (2) counting of microbial cells using flow cytometry combined with Propidium Monoazide pre-treatment of fecal samples before metagenomics DNA isolation in order to only profile the microbial composition of intact cells (QMP-PMA), and (3) molecular based quantification of the microbial load using qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Although qPCR and flow cytometry both resulted in accurate and strongly correlated results when quantifying the bacterial abundance of a mock community of bacterial cells, the two methods resulted in highly divergent quantitative microbial profiles when analyzing the microbial composition of fecal samples from 16 healthy volunteers. These differences could not be attributed to the presence of free extracellular prokaryotic DNA in the fecal samples as sample pre-treatment with Propidium Monoazide did not improve the concordance between qPCR-based and flow cytometry-based QMP. Also lack of precision of qPCR was ruled out as a major cause of the disconcordant findings, since quantification of the fecal microbial load by the highly sensitive digital droplet PCR correlated strongly with qPCR.

As a result of numerous prior studies, we know that host genotypes and abiotic factors influence the composition of plant microbiomes. However, the high complexity of these communities challenges detailed studies to define experimentally the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of community assembly and the beneficial effects of such microbiomes on plant hosts. In this work, from the distinctive microbiota assembled by maize roots, through host-mediated selection, we obtained a greatly simplified synthetic bacterial community consisting of seven strains (<i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Ochrobactrum pituitosum, Herbaspirillum frisingense, Pseudomonas putida, Curtobacterium pusillum</i>, and <i>Chryseobacterium indologenes</i>) representing three of the four most dominant phyla found in maize roots. By using a selective culture-dependent method to track the abundance of each strain, we investigated the role that each plays in community assembly on roots of axenic maize seedlings. Only the removal of <i>E. cloacae</i> led to the complete loss of the community, and <i>C. pusillum</i> took over. This result suggests that <i>E. cloacae</i> plays the role of keystone species in this model ecosystem. <i>In planta</i> and in vitro, this model community inhibited the phytopathogenic fungus <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i>, indicating a clear benefit to the host. Thus, combined with the selective culture-dependent quantification method, our synthetic seven-species community representing the root microbiome has the potential to serve as a useful system to explore how bacterial interspecies interactions affect root microbiome assembly and to dissect the beneficial effects of the root microbiota on hosts under laboratory conditions in the future.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,114,12,E2450-E2459,10.1073/pnas.1616148114,PMC5373366,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Bacteria; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Plant Roots; Soil Microbiology; Zea mays,biological control; community assembly; maize; synthetic community,"Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.; Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.

To date, most plant microbiome studies involving high-throughput amplicon sequencing have focused on the relative abundance of microbial taxa. However, this technique does not assess the total microbial load and the abundance of individual microbes relative to the amount of host plant tissues. Here, we report the development of a host-associated quantitative abundance profiling (HA-QAP) method that can accurately examine total microbial load and colonization of individual root microbiome members relative to host plants by the copy-number ratio of microbial marker gene to plant genome. We validate the HA-QAP method using mock experiments, perturbation experiments, and metagenomic sequencing. The HA-QAP method eliminates the generation of spurious outputs in the classical method based on microbial relative abundance, and reveals the load of root microbiome to host plants. Using the HA-QAP method, we found that the copy-number ratios of microbial marker genes to plant genome range from 1.07 to 6.61 for bacterial 16S rRNA genes and from 0.40 to 2.26 for fungal internal transcribed spacers in the root microbiome samples from healthy rice and wheat. Furthermore, using HA-QAP we found that an increase in total microbial load represents a key feature of changes in root microbiome of rice plants exposed to drought stress and of wheat plants with root rot disease, which significantly influences patterns of differential taxa and species interaction networks. Given its accuracy and technical feasibility, HA-QAP would facilitate our understanding of genuine interactions between root microbiome and plants.",Plant communications,1,1,100003,10.1016/j.xplc.2019.100003,PMC7747982,"Journal Article;

This often leads to spurious correlations, making the interpretation of relationships to biogeochemical rates challenging. To overcome this issue, we quantitatively estimated the abundance of microorganisms by spiking in known amounts of internal DNA standards. Using a 3-year sample set of diverse microbial communities from the Western Antarctica Peninsula, we demonstrated that the internal standard method yielded community profiles and taxon cooccurrence patterns substantially different from those derived using relative abundances. We found that the method provided results consistent with the traditional CHEMTAX analysis of pigments and total bacterial counts by flow cytometry. Using the internal standard method, we also showed that chloroplast 16S rRNA gene data in microbial surveys can be used to estimate abundances of certain eukaryotic phototrophs such as cryptophytes and diatoms. In <i>Phaeocystis</i>, scatter in the 16S/18S rRNA gene ratio may be explained by physiological adaptation to environmental conditions. We conclude that the internal standard method, when applied to rRNA gene microbial community profiling, is quantitative and that its application will substantially improve our understanding of microbial ecosystems.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> High-throughput-sequencing-based marine microbiome profiling is rapidly expanding and changing how we study the oceans. Although powerful, the technique is not fully quantitative; it provides taxon counts only in relative abundances. In order to address this issue, we present a method to quantitatively estimate microbial abundances per unit volume of seawater filtered by spiking known amounts of internal DNA standards into each sample. We validated this method by comparing the calculated abundances to other independent estimates, including chemical markers (pigments) and total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry.

Strain diversity in microbial communities is therefore considered to be of functional importance. Yet little is known about the extent to which related microbial communities differ in diversity at this level and which underlying mechanisms may constrain and maintain strain-level diversity. Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to characterize and compare the gut microbiota of two honey bee species, Apis mellifera and Apis cerana, which diverged about 6 mya. Although the host species are colonized largely by the same bacterial 16S rRNA phylotypes, we find that their communities are host specific when analyzed with genomic resolution. Moreover, despite their similar ecology, A. mellifera displayed a much higher diversity of strains and functional gene content in the microbiota compared to A. cerana, both per colony and per individual bee. In particular, the gene repertoire for polysaccharide degradation was massively expanded in the microbiota of A. mellifera relative to A. cerana. Bee management practices, divergent ecological adaptation, or habitat size may have contributed to the observed differences in microbiota genomic diversity of these key pollinator species. Our results illustrate that the gut microbiota of closely related animal hosts can differ vastly in genomic diversity while displaying similar levels of diversity based on the 16S rRNA gene.

Shotgun data, which unlike the amplicon data capture the ratio of microbe to plant DNA, enable scaling of microbial read abundances to reflect the microbial load on the host. In a more cost-effective hybrid strategy, we show they also allow a similar scaling of amplicon data to overcome compositionality problems. Our wild plants were dominated by bacterial sequences, with eukaryotes contributing only a minority of reads. Microbial membership showed weak associations with both site of origin and plant genotype, both of which were highly confounded in this dataset.

However, although ob/ob and db/db mice are similarly gaining weight and developing massive obesity, db/db mice are more diabetic than ob/ob mice. It remains still unclear why targeting the same pathway-leptin signaling-leads to the development of two different phenotypes. Given that gut microbes dialogue with the host via different metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) but also contribute to the regulation of bile acids metabolism, we investigated whether inflammatory markers, bacterial components, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and gut microbes could contribute to explain the specific phenotype discriminating the onset of an obese and/or a diabetic state in ob/ob and db/db mice. Six-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were followed for 7 weeks; they had comparable body weight, fat mass, and lean mass gain, confirming their severely obese status. However, as expected, the glucose metabolism and the glucose-induced insulin secretion were significantly different between ob/ob and db/db mice. Strikingly, the fat distribution was different, with db/db mice having more subcutaneous and ob/ob mice having more epididymal fat. In addition, liver steatosis was more pronounced in the ob/ob mice than in db/db mice. We also found very distinct inflammatory profiles between ob/ob and db/db mice, with a more pronounced inflammatory tone in the liver for ob/ob mice as compared to a higher inflammatory tone in the (subcutaneous) adipose tissue for db/db mice. When analyzing the gut microbiota composition, we found that the quantity of 19 microbial taxa was in some way affected by the genotype. Furthermore, we also show that serum LPS concentration, hepatic bile acid content, and cecal short-chain fatty acid profiles were differently affected by the two genotypes. Taken together, our results elucidate potential mechanisms implicated in the development of an obese or a diabetic state in two genetic models characterized by an altered leptin signaling. We propose that these differences could be linked to specific inflammatory tones, serum LPS concentration, bile acid metabolism, short-chain fatty acid profile, and gut microbiota composition.

While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over 2 years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data show that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift toward high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease.",The ISME journal,14,3,801-814,10.1038/s41396-019-0568-8,PMC7031341,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Animals; Bacteria; Bees; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Seasons,,"Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland. philipp.engel@unil.ch.",,2025-03-25

Overall, obesity is associated with deviations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. There are many divergent findings regarding the link between the excessive intake of certain dietary components (i.e., fat and sugar) and obesity development. We therefore investigated the effect of specific diets, with a different content of sugar and fat, in promoting obesity and related comorbidities as well as their impact on microbial load and gut microbiota composition/diversity. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a low-sugar, low-fat control diet (CT), a high-sugar diet (HS), a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HF/HS), or a high-fat diet (HF) for 8 wk. The impact of the different diets on obesity, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative and ER stress was determined. Diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota composition and density were also analyzed. HF diet-fed mice showed the highest body weight and fat mass gains and displayed the most impaired glucose and insulin profiles. HS, HF/HS, and HF diets differently affected hepatic cholesterol content and mRNA expression of several markers associated with immune cells, inflammation, oxidative and ER stress in several organs/tissues. In addition, HF diet feeding resulted in a decreased microbial load at the end of the experiment. When analyzing the gut microbiota composition, we found that HS, HF/HS, and HF diets induced specific changes in the abundance of certain bacterial taxa. This was not associated with a specific change in systemic inflammatory markers, but HS mice exhibited higher FGF21 plasma levels compared with HF diet-fed mice. Taken together, our results highlight that dietary intake of different macronutrients distinctively impacts the development of an obese/diabetic state and the regulation of metabolic inflammation in specific organs. We propose that these differences are not only obesity-driven but that changes in the gut microbiota composition may play a key role in this context.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that dietary macronutrients (i.e., sugar and fat) have an impact on fecal bacterial cell counting and quantitative microbiome profiling in mice. Yet, we demonstrate that dietary fat is the determining factor to promote obesity and diabetes progression, and local inflammation in different body sites.

Quantitative PCR-based quantitative microbiome profiling (QMP) has been applied broadly for microbial analysis from absolute abundance perspectives, transforming microbiota ratios into counts by normalizing 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing data with gene copies quantified by quantitative PCR. However, the application of QMP in fermented foods is still limited. QMP elucidated microbial succession of Taiwanese pickled cabbage. In the spontaneous first-round fermentation (FR), the 16S rRNA gene copies of total bacteria increased from 6.1 to 10 log copies mL<sup>-1</sup>. The dominant lactic acid bacteria genera were successively Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactiplantibacillus. Despite the decrease in the proportion of Lactococcus during the succession, the absolute abundance of Lactococcus still increased. In the backslopping second-round fermentation (SR), the total bacteria 16S rRNA gene copies increased from 7.6 to 9.9 log copies mL<sup>-1</sup>. The addition of backslopping starter and vinegar rapidly led to a homogenous microbial community dominated by Lactiplantibacillus. The proportion of Lactiplantibacillus remained consistently around 90% during SR, whereas its absolute abundance exhibited a continuous increase. In SR without vinegar, Leuconostoc consistently dominated the fermentation. The present study highlights that compositional analysis would misinterpret microbial dynamics, whereas QMP reflected the real succession profiles and unveiled the essential role of vinegar in promoting Lactiplantibacillus dominance in backslopping fermentation of Taiwanese pickled cabbage.

This study aimed to explore the association of gut microbiota with the risk of osteoporosis and to identify potential disease-related taxa, which may be promising targets in osteoporosis prevention and treatment in the future. Absolute quantification 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to detect absolute and relative abundances of gut microbiota in 44 patients with osteoporosis and 64 controls. In combination with one of our previous studies, a total of 175 samples were involved in the relative abundance analysis. Compared with the controls, the patients with osteoporosis had higher absolute and relative abundances of Bacteroidetes phylum, and <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Eisenbergiella</i> genera. The absolute abundances of <i>Clostridium_XlVa</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Eggerthella</i> genera increased, and that of the <i>Veillonella</i> genus decreased in the osteoporosis group. As for relative abundance, that of the <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Flavonifractor</i> genera increased, whereas that of the <i>Raoultella</i> genus decreased in the osteoporosis group. Controlling for potential confounders, the associations of <i>Clostridium_XlVa</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i> genera with the risk of osteoporosis did not maintain significance. Ridge regression analysis suggested that <i>Bacteroides</i> is associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and T-score at lumbar spines, and <i>Anaerovorax</i> is associated with increased BMD at the femoral neck. Functional predictions revealed that 10 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were enriched in the osteoporosis group.

Innovations in DNA sequencing have significantly increased our knowledge of the skin microbiome. However, current characterizations do not discriminate between DNA from live cells and remnant DNA from dead organisms (relic DNA), resulting in a combined readout of all microorganisms that were and are currently present on the skin rather than the actual living population of the microbiome. Additionally, most methods lack the capability for absolute quantification of the microbial load on the skin, complicating the extrapolation of clinically relevant information. Here, we integrated relic-DNA depletion with shotgun metagenomics and bacterial load determination to quantify live bacterial cell abundances across different skin sites. Though we discovered up to 90% of microbial DNA from the skin to be relic DNA, we saw no significant effect of this on the relative abundances of taxa determined by shotgun sequencing. Relic-DNA depletion prior to sequencing strengthened underlying patterns between microbiomes across volunteers and reduced intraindividual similarity. We determined the absolute abundance and the fraction of population alive for several common skin taxa across body sites and found taxa-specific differential abundance of live bacteria across regions to be different from estimates generated by total DNA (live + dead) sequencing. Our results reveal the significant bias relic DNA has on the quantification of low biomass samples like the skin. The reduced intraindividual similarity across samples following relic-DNA depletion highlights the bias introduced by traditional (total DNA) sequencing in diversity comparisons across samples. The divergent levels of cell viability measured across different skin sites, along with the inconsistencies in taxa differential abundance determined by total vs live cell DNA sequencing, suggest an important hypothesis for certain sites being susceptible to pathogen infection. Overall, our study demonstrates a characterization of the skin microbiome that overcomes relic-DNA bias to provide a baseline for live microbiota that will further improve mechanistic studies of infection, disease progression, and the design of therapies for the skin.

Previous studies have mostly been based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is limited in taxonomic resolution at the genus level and inferred functionality. Herein, we performed a deep shotgun metagenomics study with the aim to obtain a more precise landscape of gut microbiome dysbiosis in HIV-1 infection. A reduced tendency of alpha diversity and significantly higher beta diversity were found in HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-1-negative controls. Several species, such as <i>Streptococcus anginosus</i>, <i>Actinomyces odontolyticus</i>, and <i>Rothia mucilaginosa</i>, were significantly enriched in the HIV-1-ART group. Correlations were observed between the degree of immunodeficiency and gut microbiome in terms of microbiota composition and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, microbial shift in HIV-1-infected individuals was found to be associated with changes in microbial virulome and resistome. From the perspective of methodological evaluations, our study showed that different DNA extraction protocols significantly affect the genomic DNA quantity and quality.

We assessed the potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to eradicate CPE carriage and aimed to explain failure or success through microbiome analyses. In this prospective cohort study, all consenting eligible CPE carriers received oral capsulized FMT for 2 days. Primary outcome was CPE eradication at 1 month, defined by 3 consecutive negative rectal swabs, the last also negative for carbapenemase gene by polymerase chain reaction. Comprehensive metagenomics analysis of the intestinal microbiome of donors and recipients before and after FMT was performed. Fifteen CPE carriers received FMT, 13 of whom completed 2 days of treatment. CPE eradication at 1 month was successful in 9/15 and 9/13, respectively. Bacterial communities showed significant changes in both beta and alpha diversity metrics among participants who achieved CPE eradication that were not observed among failures. Post-FMT samples' beta-diversity clustered according to the treatment outcome, both in taxonomy and in function. We observed a significant decrease in beta diversity in participants who received post-FMT antibiotics. Enterobacteriaceae abundance decreased in post-FMT samples of the responders but increased among failures. Functionally, a clear demarcation between responders (who were similar to the donors) and failures was shown, driven by antimicrobial resistance genes. Our study provides the biological explanation for the effect of FMT against CPE carriage. Decolonization of CPE by FMT is likely mediated by compositional and functional shifts in the microbiome. Thus, FMT might be an efficient strategy for sustained CPE eradication.

As gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms, the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in PD pathogenesis. Alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of L-DOPA-naïve PD patients might also serve as a biomarker. We performed metagenomic shotgun analyses and compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage, L-DOPA-naïve PD patients to 28 age-matched controls. We found increased Verrucomicrobiaceae (Akkermansia muciniphila) and unclassified Firmicutes, whereas Prevotellaceae (Prevotella copri) and Erysipelotrichaceae (Eubacterium biforme) were markedly lowered in PD samples. The observed differences could reliably separate PD from control with a ROC-AUC of 0.84. Functional analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in microbiota metabolism in PD involving the ẞ-glucuronate and tryptophan metabolism. While the abundances of prophages and plasmids did not differ between PD and controls, total virus abundance was decreased in PD participants. Based on our analyses, the intake of either a MAO inhibitor, amantadine, or a dopamine agonist (which in summary relates to 90% of PD patients) had no overall influence on taxa abundance or microbial functions. Our data revealed differences of colonic microbiota and of microbiota metabolism between PD patients and controls at an unprecedented detail not achievable through 16S sequencing.

In this study, faecal samples from 35 Swedish university students were examined through shotgun metagenomics before and after travel to the Indian peninsula or Central Africa. We aimed at assessing the impact of travel on Blastocystis carriage and seek associations between Blastocystis and the bacterial microbiota. We found a prevalence of Blastocystis of 16/35 (46%) before travel and 15/35 (43%) after travel. The two most commonly Blastocystis subtypes (STs) found were ST3 and ST4, accounting for 20 of the 31 samples positive for Blastocystis. No mixed subtype carriage was detected. All ten individuals with a typable ST before and after travel maintained their initial ST. The composition of the gut bacterial community was not significantly different between Blastocystis-carriers and non-carriers. Interestingly, the presence of Blastocystis was accompanied with higher abundances of the bacterial genera Sporolactobacillus and Candidatus Carsonella. Blastocystis carriage was positively associated with high bacterial genus richness, and negatively correlated to the Bacteroides-driven enterotype. These associations were both largely dependent on ST4 - a subtype commonly described from Europe - while the globally prevalent ST3 did not show such significant relationships. The high rate of Blastocystis subtype persistence found during travel indicates that long-term carriage of Blastocystis is common. The associations between Blastocystis and the bacterial microbiota found in this study could imply a link between Blastocystis and a healthy microbiota as well as with diets high in vegetables.

Microbial features consistently altered in PD compared to HC and PC subjects were identified. Data were cross-referenced to public metagenomic data sets from two previous studies in Germany and China to determine generalizable microbiome features. We find several significantly altered taxa between PD and controls within the two cohorts sequenced in this study. Analysis across global cohorts returns consistent changes only in Intestinimonas butyriciproducens. Pathway enrichment analysis reveals disruptions in microbial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and increased amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in PD. Global gene-level signatures indicate an increased response to oxidative stress, decreased cellular growth and microbial motility, and disrupted intercommunity signaling. A metagenomic meta-analysis of PD shows consistent and novel alterations in functional metabolic potential and microbial gene abundance across four independent studies from three continents.

Here, we investigate this question by comparing the mobile genes found in the microbiomes of 81 metropolitan North Americans with those of 172 agrarian Fiji islanders using a combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics. We find large differences in mobile gene content between the Fijian and North American microbiomes, with functional variation that mirrors known dietary differences such as the excess of plant-based starch degradation genes found in Fijian individuals. Notably, we also observed differences between the mobile gene pools of neighbouring Fijian villages, even though microbiome composition across villages is similar. Finally, we observe high rates of recombination leading to individual-specific mobile elements, suggesting that the abundance of some genes may reflect environmental selection rather than dispersal limitation.

Case reports have described therapeutic benefit of FMT in patients with UC, possibly due to changes in the microbiota. We measured the degree to which the transplanted microbiota engraft following FMT in patients with UC using a donor similarity index (DSI). Seven patients with mild to moderate UC (UC disease activity index scores 3-10) received a single colonoscopic administration of FMT. Metagenomic sequence data from stool were analyzed using an alignment-free comparison tool, to measure the DSI, and a phylogenetic analysis tool, to characterize taxonomic changes. Clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and fecal calprotectin outcome measures were also collected. One of 5 patients from whom sequencing data were available achieved the primary endpoint of 50% donor similarity at week 4; an additional 2 patients achieved 40% donor similarity. One patient with 40% donor similarity achieved clinical and histologic remission 1 month after FMT. However, these were lost by 2-3 months, and loss correlated with a decrease in DSI. The remaining patients did not demonstrate clinical response or remission. Histology scores improved in all but 1 patient. No patients remained in remission at 3 months after FMT. Following a single colonoscopic fecal transplant, a DSI of 40-50% is achieved in about two-thirds of recipients.

Recent studies suggest that gut bacterial communities influence how humans recover from infectious diarrhea, but we still lack extensive data and mechanistic hypotheses for how these bacterial communities respond to diarrheal disease and its treatment. Here, we report that after Vibrio cholerae infection, the human gut microbiota undergoes an orderly and reproducible succession that features transient reversals in relative levels of enteric Bacteroides and Prevotella. Elements of this succession may be a common feature in microbiota recovery from acute secretory diarrhea, as we observed similar successional dynamics after enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection. Our metagenomic analyses suggest that multiple mechanisms drive microbial succession after cholera, including bacterial dispersal properties, changing enteric oxygen and carbohydrate levels, and phage dynamics. Thus, gut microbiota recovery after cholera may be predictable at the level of community structure but is driven by a complex set of temporally varying ecological processes. Our findings suggest opportunities for diagnostics and therapies targeting the gut microbiota in humans recovering from infectious diarrhea. Disability after diarrhea is a major burden on public health in the developing world. Gut bacteria may affect this recovery, but it remains incompletely understood how resident microbes in the digestive tract respond to diarrheal illness. Here, we observed an orderly and reproducible succession of gut bacterial groups after cholera in humans.

We analyzed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of fecal and serum samples. The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with Prevotella and also showed an enrichment of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium and had an enrichment of short chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with Prevotella. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs was found to be higher in the fecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters. The study reveals the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations.

Among IN responders, the gut microbiome was enriched for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis. Among P responders, the microbiome was enriched for Dorea formicogenerans. Unbiased shotgun metabolomics revealed high levels of anacardic acid in ICT responders.

While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n = 155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and non-IBD control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While > 50% of differentially abundant metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Nature microbiology,4,2,293-305,10.1038/s41564-018-0306-4,PMC6342642,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Biodiversity; Biomarkers; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex; Metabolome; Metagenome",,"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.; Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Gastrointestinal Unit and Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Gastrointestinal Unit and Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Gastrointestinal Unit and Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Genetics, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research Inc., Basel, Switzerland.; Department of Genetics, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Genetics, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Genetics, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Immunology, K.G.

The present data set describes the engraftment and includes participants from the study who received active FMT; 14 participants with effect of FMT (<i>Effect</i>) and 8 without (<i>No effect</i>). Samples were collected at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. Samples from the transplants (<i>Donor</i>) served as a comparator. In total 66 recipient samples and 17 donor samples were subjected to deep metagenomic sequencing, and taxonomic and functional analyses were performed. Alpha diversity measures showed a significantly increased diversity and evenness in the IBS groups compared to the donors. Taxonomic profiles showed higher relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes, and lower relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, compared to donors at baseline. This profile was shifted toward the donor profile following FMT. Imputed growth rates showed that the resulting growth pattern was a conglomerate of donor and recipient activity. Thirty-four functional subclasses showed distinct differences between baseline samples and donors, most of which were shifted toward a donor-like profile after FMT.

Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes. We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn. We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut. This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.",Genome medicine,9,1,103,10.1186/s13073-017-0490-5,PMC5704459,Journal Article,"Adult;

Here, we undertook a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial involving 60 middle-aged Danish adults without known disorders with two 8-week interventions comparing a low-gluten diet (2 g gluten per day) and a high-gluten diet (18 g gluten per day), separated by a washout period of at least six weeks with habitual diet (12 g gluten per day). We find that, in comparison with a high-gluten diet, a low-gluten diet induces moderate changes in the intestinal microbiome, reduces fasting and postprandial hydrogen exhalation, and leads to improvements in self-reported bloating.

Here we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to provide a detailed characterization of the compositional and functional features of the CD microbiota, comprising also unannotated bacteria, and investigated its modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition. Based on signature taxa, CD microbiotas clustered into 2 distinct metacommunities, indicating individual variability in CD microbiome structure. Metacommunity-specific functional shifts in CD showed enrichment in producers of the pro-inflammatory hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide variant and a reduction in the potential to synthesize short-chain fatty acids. Disruption of ecological networks was evident in CD, coupled with reduction in growth rates of many bacterial species. Short-term exclusive enteral nutrition elicited limited impact on the overall composition of the CD microbiota, although functional changes occurred following treatment.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic progressive disease with an unknown etiology that may be related to the gut microbiome. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of its pathogenesis is necessary for directing future therapy.<b>Aim</b>. We aimed to determine the differences in intestinal microbial composition between healthy individuals and patients with AS who received and who did not receive treatment interventions. In parallel, the pathology of AS in each patient was analysed to better understand the link between AS treatment and the intestinal microbiota of the patients.<b>Methodology</b>. Sixty-six faecal DNA samples, including 37 from healthy controls (HCs), 11 from patients with untreated AS (NM), 7 from patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. celecoxib; WM) and 11 from patients treated with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), such as the Bushen-Qiangdu-Zhilv decoction, were collected and used in the drug effect analysis. All samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 and the microbial composition was determined.<b>Results</b>. Four species were enriched in the patients with AS: <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Oscillibacter</i>, <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> and <i>Bacteroides nordii</i> (HC vs. NM, <i>P</i><0.05); only <i>F. plautii</i> was found to be significantly changed in the NM-HC comparison. No additional species were found in the HC vs. CHM analysis, which indicated a beneficial effect of CHM in removing the other three strains. <i>F. plautii</i> was found to be significantly increased in the comparison between the HC and WM groups, along with four other species (<i>Clostridium bolteae</i>, Clostridiales bacterium 1_7_47FAA, <i>C. asparagiforme</i> and <i>C. hathewayi</i>). The patients with AS harboured more bacterial species associated with carbohydrate metabolism and glycan biosynthesis in their faeces. They also had bacterial profiles less able to biodegrade xenobiotics or synthesize and transport vitamins.<b>Conclusion</b>. The gut microbiota of the patients with AS varied from that of the HCs, and the treatment had an impact on this divergence.

We observe significantly higher genus-level resilience in non-industrial populations, while SCFA production in industrial populations is driven by a few phylogenetically closely related species (belonging to Bacteroides and Clostridium), meaning industrial microbiomes have low resilience potential.

Here, we performed an integrated shotgun metagenomic systematic meta-analysis of new and publicly available stool microbiomes collected from 226 triads of donors, pre-FMT recipients and post-FMT recipients across eight different disease types. By leveraging improved metagenomic strain-profiling to infer strain sharing, we found that recipients with higher donor strain engraftment were more likely to experience clinical success after FMT (P = 0.017) when evaluated across studies. Considering all cohorts, increased engraftment was noted in individuals receiving FMT from multiple routes (for example, both via capsules and colonoscopy during the same treatment) as well as in antibiotic-treated recipients with infectious diseases compared with antibiotic-naïve patients with noncommunicable diseases. Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria species (including Bifidobacteria) displayed higher engraftment than Firmicutes except for six under-characterized Firmicutes species. Cross-dataset machine learning predicted the presence or absence of species in the post-FMT recipient at 0.77 average AUROC in leave-one-dataset-out evaluation, and highlighted the relevance of microbial abundance, prevalence and taxonomy to infer post-FMT species presence.

Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects.

CDI patients were clustered using the bacterial composition of the gut: one with high population of Enterococcus (cluster 1, n = 12) and another of Bacteroides or Lactobacillus (cluster 2, n = 14). Cluster1 showed significantly lower bacterial diversity and clinical cure at the end of treatment. Additionally, patients with CDI exhibited increased ARGs; notably, bla<sub>TEM</sub>, bla<sub>SHV</sub> and bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> were enriched. C. difficile existed in variable proportion of the gut microbiome in CDI patients.

Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available ( www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/ ).

In this study, we performed metagenomic analysis to comprehensively assess the longitudinal variation in the intestinal microbiota of 28 KD patients. Several notable bacterial genera were commonly extracted during the acute phase, whereas a relative increase in the number of Ruminococcus bacteria was observed during the non-acute phase of KD. The metagenomic analysis results based on bacterial species classification suggested that the number of sequencing reads with similarity to five Streptococcus spp. (S. pneumonia, pseudopneumoniae, oralis, gordonii, and sanguinis), in addition to patient-derived Streptococcus isolates, markedly increased during the acute phase in most patients.

The metagenomic analysis of samples from both groups revealed differences in the signatures between them. The signatures consisted of the bacterial genera and aminoglycoside, β-lactam, macrolide, and tetracycline resistance genes that they harbored. Our results show an increase in ARGs in the resistome of the GM of children with ASD. These findings emphasize the negative influence of early-life antibiotic therapy.

This ecosystem is known to be shaped by many factors, including climate, geography, host nutrition, lifestyle and medication. Thus, knowledge of varying populations with different habits is important for a better understanding of the microbiome. We therefore conducted a metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota from Kazakh donors, recruiting 84 subjects, including male and female healthy subjects and metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients aged 25-75 years, from the Kazakh administrative centre, Astana. We characterise and describe these microbiomes, the first deep-sequencing cohort from Central Asia, in comparison with a global dataset (832 individuals from five countries on three continents), and explore correlations between microbiota, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as with nutritional data from Food Frequency Questionnaires. We observe that Kazakh microbiomes are relatively different from both European and East Asian counterparts, though similar to other Central Asian microbiomes, with the most striking difference being significantly more samples falling within the <i>Prevotella</i>-rich enterotype, potentially reflecting regional diet and lifestyle. We show that this enterotype designation remains stable within an individual over time in 82% of cases. We further observe gut microbiome features that distinguish MetS patients from controls (eg, significantly reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, <i>Bifidobacteria</i> and <i>Subdoligranulum</i>, alongside increased <i>Prevotella</i>), though these overlap little with previously published reports and thus may reflect idiosyncrasies of the present cohort. Taken together, this exploratory study describes gut microbiome data from an understudied population, providing a starting point for further comparative work on biogeography and research on widespread diseases.

Currently, there are no effective modalities for decreasing or preventing colonization by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Intestinal microbiota restoration can prevent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrences. Another potential application of microbiota restoration is suppression of non-C. difficile multidrug-resistant bacteria and overall decrease in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (the resistome) within the gut microbiota. This study characterizes the effects of RBX2660, a microbiota-based investigational therapeutic, on the composition and abundance of the gut microbiota and resistome, as well as multidrug-resistant organism carriage, after delivery to patients suffering from recurrent CDI. An open-label, multi-center clinical trial in 11 centers in the USA for the safety and efficacy of RBX2660 on recurrent CDI was conducted. Fecal specimens from 29 of these subjects with recurrent CDI who received either one (N = 16) or two doses of RBX2660 (N = 13) were analyzed secondarily. Stool samples were collected prior to and at intervals up to 6 months post-therapy and analyzed in three ways: (1) 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiota taxonomic composition, (2) whole metagenome shotgun sequencing for functional pathways and antibiotic resistome content, and (3) selective and differential bacterial culturing followed by isolate genome sequencing to longitudinally track multidrug-resistant organisms. Successful prevention of CDI recurrence with RBX2660 correlated with taxonomic convergence of patient microbiota to the donor microbiota as measured by weighted UniFrac distance. RBX2660 dramatically reduced the abundance of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the 2 months after administration. Fecal antibiotic resistance gene carriage decreased in direct relationship to the degree to which donor microbiota engrafted. Microbiota-based therapeutics reduce resistance gene abundance and resistant organisms in the recipient gut microbiome. This approach could potentially reduce the risk of infections caused by resistant organisms within the patient and the transfer of resistance genes or pathogens to others.

Here we investigated how well taxonomic and functional intestinal microbiome data and their combination with clinical data can be used to discriminate between amyloid-positive AD patients and cognitively healthy elderly controls. In the present study we investigated intestinal microbiome in 75 amyloid-positive AD patients and 100 cognitively healthy controls participating in the AlzBiom study. We randomly split the data into a training and a validation set. Intestinal microbiome was measured using shotgun metagenomics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to examine the discriminatory ability of intestinal microbiome among diagnostic groups. The best model for discrimination of amyloid-positive AD patients from healthy controls with taxonomic data was obtained analyzing 18 genera features, and yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 in the training set and 0.61 in the validation set. The best models with functional data were obtained analyzing 17 GO (Gene Ontology) features with an AUROC of 0.81 in the training set and 0.75 in the validation set and 26 KO [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog] features with an AUROC of 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. Using ensemble learning for these three models including a clinical model with the 4 parameters age, gender, BMI and ApoE yielded an AUROC of 0.92 in the training set and 0.80 in the validation set. In conclusion, we identified a specific Alzheimer signature in intestinal microbiome that can be used to discriminate amyloid-positive AD patients from healthy controls. The diagnostic accuracy increases from taxonomic to functional data and is even better when combining taxonomic, functional and clinical models.

These microorganisms that have acquired broad antibiotic resistance are now common human pathogens. Changes in the gut microbiome, induced by antibiotics or other drugs, enable expansion of these microorganisms, but the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The main objective was to identify specific bacteria and functional pathways and genes characterizing the gut microbiome of nursing home residents carrying ESBL-E, using metagenomics. We included 144 residents living in two different nursing homes. All fecal samples were screened for ESBL-E and gut microbiome was characterized using shallow shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing. Ten nursing home residents were colonized by ESBL-E, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae species, and were compared to non-carriers. We found that ESBL-E carriers had an alteration in within-sample diversity. Using a bootstrap algorithm, we found that the gut microbiome of ESBL-E carriers was depleted in butyrate-producing species, enriched in succinate-producing species and enriched in pathways involved in intracellular pH homeostasis compared to non-carriers individuals. Several energy metabolism pathways were overrepresented in ESBL-E carriers suggesting a greater ability to metabolize multiple microbiota and mucus layer-derived nutrients. The gut microbiome of ESBL-E carriers in nursing homes harbors specific taxonomic and functional characteristics, conferring an environment that enables Enterobacteriaceae expansion.

However, we lack a sufficient understanding of which microbial populations successfully colonize the recipient gut, and the widely used approaches to study the microbial ecology of FMT experiments fail to provide enough resolution to identify populations that are likely responsible for FMT-derived benefits. We used shotgun metagenomics together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from fecal samples of a single FMT donor. We then used metagenomic mapping to track the occurrence and distribution patterns of donor MAGs in two FMT recipients. Our analyses revealed that 22% of the 92 highly complete bacterial MAGs that we identified from the donor successfully colonized and remained abundant in two recipients for at least 8 weeks. Most MAGs with a high colonization rate belonged to the order Bacteroidales. The vast majority of those that lacked evidence of colonization belonged to the order Clostridiales, and colonization success was negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation. Our analysis of 151 publicly available gut metagenomes showed that the donor MAGs that colonized both recipients were prevalent, and the ones that colonized neither were rare across the participants of the Human Microbiome Project. Although our dataset showed a link between taxonomy and the colonization ability of a given MAG, we also identified MAGs that belong to the same taxon with different colonization properties, highlighting the importance of an appropriate level of resolution to explore the functional basis of colonization and to identify targets for cultivation, hypothesis generation, and testing in model systems. The analytical strategy adopted in our study can provide genomic insights into bacterial populations that may be critical to the efficacy of FMT due to their success in gut colonization and metabolic properties, and guide cultivation efforts to investigate mechanistic underpinnings of this procedure beyond associations.",Microbiome,5,1,50,10.1186/s40168-017-0270-x,PMC5418705,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult; Bacteria; Clostridium Infections; DNA, Bacterial; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Living Donors; Male; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult",Colonization; Fecal microbiota transplantation; Metagenome-assembled genomes; Metagenomics,"Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Present address: Boston Children's Hospital, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Boston, MA, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, 02543, MA, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. meren@uchicago.edu.; Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, 02543, MA, USA. meren@uchicago.edu.",,2025-03-25

Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide, yet whether gut microbiota dysbiosis participates in the development of hypertension remains largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we carried out comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses in a cohort of 41 healthy controls, 56 subjects with pre-hypertension, 99 individuals with primary hypertension, and performed fecal microbiota transplantation from patients to germ-free mice. Compared to the healthy controls, we found dramatically decreased microbial richness and diversity, Prevotella-dominated gut enterotype, distinct metagenomic composition with reduced bacteria associated with healthy status and overgrowth of bacteria such as Prevotella and Klebsiella, and disease-linked microbial function in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive populations. Unexpectedly, the microbiome characteristic in pre-hypertension group was quite similar to that in hypertension. The metabolism changes of host with pre-hypertension or hypertension were identified to be closely linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis. And a disease classifier based on microbiota and metabolites was constructed to discriminate pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals from controls accurately. Furthermore, by fecal transplantation from hypertensive human donors to germ-free mice, elevated blood pressure was observed to be transferrable through microbiota, and the direct influence of gut microbiota on blood pressure of the host was demonstrated.

To better understand the role and ecological dynamics of these commensal and potentially beneficial protozoan symbionts, we need efficient methods to detect them, as well as accurate estimates of their prevalence across human populations. Metagenomics provides such an opportunity, allowing simultaneous detection of multiple symbionts in a single analytical procedure. In this study, we collected fecal samples of 68 individuals from three Cameroonian populations with different subsistence modes and compared metagenomics-based and targeted methods of detection for two common protozoan genera: Blastocystis and Entamoeba. In addition, we analyzed our data along with publicly available fecal metagenomes from various worldwide populations to explore the prevalence and association patterns of ten protozoan genera. Regarding the detection method, microscopy was much less sensitive than metagenomics for Entamoeba, whereas qPCR was at least as sensitive as metagenomics for Blastocystis sp. However, metagenomics was more likely to detect co-colonizations by multiple subtypes. Out of the ten examined genera in 127 individuals from Cameroon, Tanzania, Peru, Italy or USA, only three (Blastocystis, Entamoeba and Enteromonas) had an overall prevalence exceeding 10%. All three genera were more common in less industrialized populations and their prevalence differed between continents and subsistence modes, albeit not in a straightforward manner. The majority (72.5%) of colonized individuals carried at least two protozoan species, indicating that mixed-species colonizations are common. In addition, we detected only positive and no negative association patterns between different protozoa. Despite the pitfalls of the metagenomic approach, ranging from the availability of good-quality sequencing data to the lack of standard analytical procedures, we demonstrated its utility in simultaneous detection of multiple protozoan genera, and especially its ability to efficiently detect mixed-species colonizations. Our study corroborates and expands prevalence results previously obtained for Blastocystis sp. and provides novel data for Entamoeba spp. and several other protozoan genera.

The aim of this work is to study microbiota changes in the course of weight loss therapy and the following year in obese individuals with or without co-morbidities, and to asses a possible predictive value of the gut microbiota with regard to weight loss maintenance. Sixteen adult patients, who followed a 52-week weight-loss program comprising low calorie diet, exercise and behavioral therapy, were selected according to their weight-loss course. Over two years, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed and microbiota from stool samples was functionally and taxonomically analyzed using DNA shotgun sequencing. Overall the microbiota responded to the dietetic and lifestyle intervention but tended to return to the initial situation both at the taxonomical and functional level at the end of the intervention after one year, except for an increase in Akkermansia abundance which remained stable over two years (12.7x103 counts, 95%CI: 322-25100 at month 0; 141x103 counts, 95%CI: 49-233x103 at month 24; p = 0.005).

Participants, who succeeded in losing their weight consistently over the two years, had at baseline a microbiota enriched in Alistipes, Pseudoflavonifractor and enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway compared to patients who were less successful in weight reduction.

We observed distinct rural-urban differences in bacterial and viral populations, with geography exhibiting a greater influence than diarrheal status. <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> disease was more commonly observed in urban subjects, and their microbiomes were enriched in metabolic pathways relating to the metabolism of industrial compounds and genes encoding resistance to 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. By linking phages present in the microbiome to their bacterial hosts through CRISPR spacers, phage variation could be directly related to shifts in bacterial populations, with the auxiliary metabolic potential of rural-associated phages enriched for carbon and amino acid energy metabolism. We report distinct differences in antimicrobial resistance gene profiles, enrichment of metabolic pathways and phage composition between rural and urban populations, as well as a higher burden of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> disease in the urban population. Our results reveal that geography is the key driver of variation in urban and rural Indian microbiomes, with acute diarrheal disease, including <i>C. difficile</i> disease exerting a lesser impact. Future studies will be required to understand the potential role of dietary, cultural, and genetic factors in contributing to microbiome differences between rural and urban populations.",Gut microbes,12,1,1752605,10.1080/19490976.2020.1752605,PMC7781581,"Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Carbapenems; Cephalosporins; Clostridioides difficile; Diarrhea; Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; India; Male; Metagenomics; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Urban Population; Young Adult",Clostridioides difficile; Central India; Gut microbiome; antibiotic resistome; diarrhea; virome,"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Nottingham , Nottingham, UK.; Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham , Nottingham, UK.; School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham , Nottingham, UK.; APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.; School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham , Leicestershire, UK.; School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham , Leicestershire, UK.; Advanced Data Analysis Centre, Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham , Leicestershire, UK.; Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Leeds , UK.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.; Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, King's Mill Hospital, Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust , Sutton in Ashfield, UK.; Mahatma Gandhi Tribal Hospital , Dharni, India.; APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.; APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.; Biochemistry Research Centre, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur, India.",,2025-03-25

We investigated the genomics of bacterial composition following FMT in immunocompromised patients over a 1-year period. Metagenomic, strain and gene-level bacterial dynamics were characterized in two CDAD-affected hematopoietic stem cell (HCT) recipients following FMT. We found alterations in gene content, including loss of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. These alterations were accompanied by long-term bacterial divergence at the species and strain levels. Our findings suggest limited durability of the specific bacterial consortium introduced with FMT and indicate that alterations of the functional potential of the microbiome are more complex than can be inferred by taxonomic information alone.

Taxonomic and functional profiles of the microbiomes were characterized, and metagenomic classifiers to predict PDAC were constructed and validated in external datasets. Comparative metagenomics revealed dysbiosis of both the gut and oral microbiomes and identified 30 gut and 18 oral species significantly associated with PDAC in the Japanese cohort. These microbial signatures achieved high area under the curve values of 0.78 to 0.82. The prediction model trained on the Japanese gut microbiome also had high predictive ability in Spanish and German cohorts, with respective area under the curve values of 0.74 and 0.83, validating its high confidence and versatility for PDAC prediction. Significant enrichments of Streptococcus and Veillonella spp and a depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were common gut signatures for PDAC in all the 3 cohorts. Prospective follow-up data revealed that patients with certain gut and oral microbial species were at higher risk of PDAC-related mortality. Finally, 58 bacteriophages that could infect microbial species consistently enriched in patients with PDAC across the 3 countries were identified.

The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS.

Here, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted metabolomic analyses on 847 faecal samples from 262 patients with acute or chronic liver disease, we demonstrate that patients hospitalized for liver disease have reduced microbiome diversity and a paucity of bioactive metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids and bile acid derivatives, that impact immune defences and epithelial barrier integrity.

This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of a specific dietary fiber consisting of a wheat-bran extract enriched in arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) in a human intervention trial. An integrated multi-omics analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects of an intervention trial with an AXOS-enriched diet in overweight individuals with indices of metabolic syndrome. Microbiome analyses were performed by shotgun DNA sequencing in feces; in-depth metabolomics using nuclear magnetic resonance in fecal, urine, and plasma samples; and massive lipid profiling using mass spectrometry in fecal and serum/plasma samples. In addition to their bifidogenic effect, we observed that AXOS boost the proportion of <i>Prevotella</i> species. Metagenome analysis showed increases in the presence of bacterial genes involved in vitamin/cofactor production, glycan metabolism, and neurotransmitter biosynthesis as a result of AXOS intake. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed reductions in plasma ceramide levels. Finally, we observed associations between <i>Prevotella</i> abundance and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and succinate concentration in feces and identified a potential protective role of <i>Eubacterium rectale</i> against metabolic disease given that its abundance was positively associated with plasma phosphatidylcholine levels, thus hypothetically reducing bioavailability of choline for methylamine biosynthesis.

This multi-omics assessment, on different biological samples of overweight subjects with signs of metabolic syndrome, sheds light on the early and less evident effects of short-term AXOS intake on intestinal microbiota and host metabolism. We observed a deep influence of AXOS on gut microbiota beyond their recognized bifidogenic effect by boosting concomitantly a wide diversity of butyrate producers and <i>Prevotella copri</i>, a microbial species abundant in non-Westernized populations with traditional lifestyle and diets enriched in fresh unprocessed foods.

Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been associated with obesity and some of its co-morbidities, like type 2 diabetes, and major changes of gut microbial communities have been hypothesized to mediate part of the beneficial metabolic effects observed after RYGB. Here we describe changes in gut microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential following RYGB. We recruited 13 morbidly obese patients who underwent RYGB, carefully phenotyped them, and had their gut microbiomes quantified before (n = 13) and 3 months (n = 12) and 12 months (n = 8) after RYGB. Following shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the fecal microbial DNA purified from stools, we characterized the gut microbial composition at species and gene levels followed by functional annotation. In parallel with the weight loss and metabolic improvements, gut microbial diversity increased within the first 3 months after RYGB and remained high 1 year later. RYGB led to altered relative abundances of 31 species (P < 0.05, q < 0.15) within the first 3 months, including those of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Veillonella spp., Streptococcus spp., Alistipes spp., and Akkermansia muciniphila. Sixteen of these species maintained their altered relative abundances during the following 9 months. Interestingly, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the only species that decreased in relative abundance. Fifty-three microbial functional modules increased their relative abundance between baseline and 3 months (P < 0.05, q < 0.17). These functional changes included increased potential (i) to assimilate multiple energy sources using transporters and phosphotransferase systems, (ii) to use aerobic respiration, (iii) to shift from protein degradation to putrefaction, and (iv) to use amino acids and fatty acids as energy sources. Within 3 months after morbidly obese individuals had undergone RYGB, their gut microbiota featured an increased diversity, an altered composition, an increased potential for oxygen tolerance, and an increased potential for microbial utilization of macro- and micro-nutrients. These changes were maintained for the first year post-RYGB.

Few studies have examined this phenomenon in humans, and none have incorporated metatranscriptomics, important for determining expression of metagenomic functions in the microbial community. In melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy, gut microbiome was characterized in pre-treatment stool using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing (n = 27). Transcriptional expression of metagenomic pathways was confirmed with metatranscriptome sequencing in a subset of 17. We examined associations of taxa and metagenomic pathways with progression-free survival (PFS) using 500 × 10-fold cross-validated elastic-net penalized Cox regression. Higher microbial community richness was associated with longer PFS in 16S and shotgun data (p < 0.05). Clustering based on overall microbiome composition divided patients into three groups with differing PFS; the low-risk group had 99% lower risk of progression than the high-risk group at any time during follow-up (p = 0.002).

Using mWGS sequencing data, we showed that the gut microbiomes of 33 cyclists split into three taxonomic clusters, characterized by either high Prevotella, high Bacteroides or a mix of many genera including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia. While no significant correlations could be found between taxonomic cluster and being either a professional or amateur level cyclist, high abundance of the genus Prevotella (≥2.5%) was significantly correlated with time reported exercising during an average week. Increased abundance of Prevotella was correlated with a number of amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways, including branched chain amino acid metabolism. Further analysis of the metatranscriptome revealed significant taxonomic differences when compared to the metagenome. There was increased abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii transcripts in a number of professional cyclists in comparison to amateur cyclists and this archaeon had upregulation of genes involved in the production of methane. Furthermore, when methane metabolism was upregulated, there was similar upregulation of energy and carbohydrate metabolism pathways.

However, the identification and tracking of microbial strains in fecal metagenomes is challenging and available tools variably classify subspecies lineages, which affects their applicability to infer microbial persistence and transfer. We introduce SameStr, a bioinformatic tool that identifies shared strains in metagenomes by determining single-nucleotide variants (SNV) in species-specific marker genes, which are compared based on a maximum variant profile similarity. We validated SameStr on mock strain populations, available human fecal metagenomes from healthy individuals and newly generated data from recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). SameStr demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to detect shared dominant and subdominant strains in related samples (where strain persistence or transfer would be expected) when compared to other tools, while being robust against false-positive shared strain calls between unrelated samples (where neither strain persistence nor transfer would be expected). We applied SameStr to identify strains that are stably maintained in fecal microbiomes of healthy adults over time (strain persistence) and that successfully engraft in rCDI patients after FMT (strain engraftment). Taxonomy-dependent strain persistence and engraftment frequencies were positively correlated, indicating that a specific core microbiota of intestinal species is adapted to be competitive both in healthy microbiomes and during post-FMT microbiome assembly. We explored other use cases for strain-level microbiota profiling, as a metagenomics quality control measure and to identify individuals based on the persisting core gut microbiota. SameStr provides for a robust identification of shared strains in metagenomic sequence data with sufficient specificity and sensitivity to examine strain persistence, transfer, and engraftment in human fecal microbiomes. Our findings identify a persisting healthy adult core gut microbiota, which should be further studied to shed light on microbiota contributions to chronic diseases.

Conversely, Ruminococcus gnavus was depleted in iCCA patients and could distinguish HCC from iCCA samples. High Veillonella genus counts in the iCCA group were associated with enriched amino acid biosynthesis and glycolysis pathways, while enriched phospholipid and thiamine metabolism pathways characterized the HCC group with high Blautia genus counts. These findings reveal distinct landscapes of gut dysbiosis among Thai iCCA and HCC patients and warrant further investigation as potential biomarkers.",Scientific reports,13,1,11406,10.1038/s41598-023-38307-2,PMC10349051,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Liver Neoplasms; Dysbiosis; Southeast Asian People; Thailand; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cholangiocarcinoma; Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic",,"Translational Research Unit, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology (EHT), OPS, MHESI, Bangkok, Thailand.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Translational Research Unit, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Liver Cancer Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.; Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand.; Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Chulabhorn Hospital, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Rajavej Hospital, Chiang Mai, 50000, Thailand.; National Cancer Institute, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.; Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, 20057, USA.; Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand.; Liver Cancer Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. xw3u@nih.gov.; Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. xw3u@nih.gov.; Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. xw3u@nih.gov.; Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, 10210, Thailand. mathuros@cri.or.th.; Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology (EHT), OPS, MHESI, Bangkok, Thailand. mathuros@cri.or.th.",,2025-03-25

The microbiomes of low-AMY1-CN subjects had enhanced capacity to break down complex carbohydrates. High-AMY1-CN subjects had higher levels of salivary Porphyromonas; their gut microbiota had increased abundance of resistant starch-degrading microbes, produced higher levels of short-chain fatty acids, and drove higher adiposity when transferred to germ-free mice.

Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the gut microbiome associated with Parkinson's disease and subsequently to screen and to validate potential diagnostic biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. This case-control study investigated gut microbial genes in faeces from 40 volunteer Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease and their healthy spouses using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, the identified specific gut microbial gene markers were validated with real-time PCR in an independent Chinese cohort of 78 Parkinson's disease patients, 75 control subjects, 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease. We developed the first gut microbial gene catalogue associated with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-five gene markers were identified that distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896 (95% confidence interval: 83.1-96.1%). A highly accurate Parkinson's disease index, which was not influenced by disease severity or Parkinson's disease medications, was created. Testing these gene markers using quantitative PCR distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls not only in the 40 couples (AUC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval: 86.4-98.0%), but also in an independent group of 78 patients with Parkinson's disease and 75 healthy control subjects (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval: 86.0-95.1%).

Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that aligns with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad-spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with certain environment and lifestyle factors and how complexity from the exogenous environment can be balanced by endogenous homeostasis.

However, it remains unclear whether such patients might benefit from enhanced surveillance or from interventions targeting the gut microbiota or the pathogens therein. We therefore undertook a prospective observational study of 24 ICU patients, in which serial faecal samples were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic profiling and microbial genome analyses. Two-thirds of the patients experienced a marked drop in gut microbial diversity (to an inverse Simpson's index of <4) at some stage during their stay in the ICU, often accompanied by the absence or loss of potentially beneficial bacteria. Intravenous administration of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent meropenem was significantly associated with loss of gut microbial diversity, but the administration of other antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, failed to trigger statistically detectable changes in microbial diversity.

However, how the initial composition of the microbiome affects the impact of antibiotics on microbial communities is relatively unexplored. To specifically address this question, we administered a second-generation cephalosporin, cefprozil, to healthy volunteers. Stool samples gathered before antibiotic exposure, at the end of the treatment and 3 months later were analysed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. On average, 15 billion nucleotides were sequenced for each sample. We show that standard antibiotic treatment can alter the gut microbiome in a specific, reproducible and predictable manner. The most consistent effect of the antibiotic was the increase of Lachnoclostridium bolteae in 16 out of the 18 cefprozil-exposed participants. Strikingly, we identified a subgroup of participants who were enriched in the opportunistic pathogen Enterobacter cloacae after exposure to the antibiotic, an effect linked to lower initial microbiome diversity and to a Bacteroides enterotype. Although the resistance gene content of participants' microbiomes was altered by the antibiotic, the impact of cefprozil remained specific to individual participants. Resistance genes that were not detectable prior to treatment were observed after a 7-day course of antibiotic administration. Specifically, point mutations in beta-lactamase blaCfxA-6 were enriched after antibiotic treatment in several participants. This suggests that monitoring the initial composition of the microbiome before treatment could assist in the prevention of some of the adverse effects associated with antibiotics or other treatments.",The ISME journal,10,3,707-20,10.1038/ismej.2015.148,PMC4817689,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cephalosporins; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Metagenomics; Young Adult; Cefprozil,,"Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec, Laboratoire de Santé Publique du Québec, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Canada.",,2025-03-25

Relatively few genomes of nonpathogenic E. coli strains are available for comparative genomic analysis, and the ecology of these strains is poorly understood. This study examined the diversity and dynamics of resident human gastrointestinal E. coli communities in the face of the ecological challenges presented by pathogen (ETEC) challenge, as well as of antibiotic treatment. Whole-genome sequences obtained from E. coli isolates from before, during, and after ETEC challenge were used in phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses to examine the diversity of the resident E. coli communities, as well as the dynamics of the challenge strain, H10407, a well-studied ETEC strain (serotype O78:H11) that produces both heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. ETEC failed to become the dominant E. coli clone in two of the six challenge subjects, each of whom exhibited limited or no clinical presentation of diarrhea. The E. coli communities of the remaining four subjects became ETEC dominant during the challenge but reverted to their original, subject-specific populations following antibiotic treatment, suggesting resiliency of the resident E. coli population following major ecological disruptions. This resiliency is likely due in part to the abundance of antibiotic-resistant ST131 E. coli strains in the resident populations. This report provides valuable insights into the potential interactions of members of the gastrointestinal microbiome and its responses to challenge by an external pathogen and by antibiotic exposure. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Research on human-associated E. coli tends to focus on pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains, which are a leading cause of diarrhea in developing countries. However, the severity of disease caused by these pathogens is thought to be influenced by the microbiome. The nonpathogenic E. coli community that resides in the human gastrointestinal tract may play a role in pathogen colonization and disease severity and may become a reservoir for virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Our study used whole-genome sequencing of E. coli before, during, and after challenge with an archetype ETEC isolate, H10407, and antibiotic treatment to explore the diversity and resiliency of the resident E. coli population in response to the ecological disturbances caused by pathogen invasion and antibiotic treatment.",mSystems,3,4,,10.1128/mSystems.00047-18,PMC6060285,Journal Article,,Escherichia coli; human challenge; resident E. coli; variation,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Center for Vaccine Development, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Center for Vaccine Development, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.",,2025-03-25

The complex cross-kingdom interactions are not well understood. A cross-sectional analysis identified conserved microbial signatures positively or negatively associated with STH infections across Liberia and Indonesia, and longitudinal samples analysis from a double-blind randomized trial showed that the gut microbiota responds to deworming but does not transition closer to the uninfected state. The microbiomes of individuals able to self-clear the infection had more alike microbiome assemblages compared to individuals who remained infected. One bacterial taxon (Lachnospiracae) was negatively associated with infection in both countries, and 12 bacterial taxa were significantly associated with STH infection in both countries, including Olsenella (associated with reduced gut inflammation), which also significantly reduced in abundance following clearance of infection. Microbial community gene abundances were also affected by deworming. Functional categories identified as associated with STH infection included arachidonic acid metabolism; arachidonic acid is the precursor for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes that threaten helminth survival, and our findings suggest that some modulation of arachidonic acid activity in the STH-infected gut may occur through the increase of arachidonic acid metabolizing bacteria. For the first time, we identify specific members of the gut microbiome that discriminate between moderately/heavily STH-infected and non-infected states across very diverse geographical regions using two different statistical methods. We also identify microbiome-encoded biological functions associated with the STH infections, which are associated potentially with STH survival strategies, and changes in the host environment.

We partnered with the Cheyenne and Arapaho (C&A), federally recognized American Indian tribes in Oklahoma, and compared gut microbiome diversity and metabolic function of C&A participants to individuals of non-native ancestry in Oklahoma (NNIs). While the C&A and NNI participants share microbiome features common to industrialized populations, the C&A participants had taxonomic profiles characterized by a reduced abundance of the anti-inflammatory bacterial genus Faecalibacterium, along with a fecal metabolite profile similar to dysbiotic states described for metabolic disorders. American Indians are known to be at elevated risk for metabolic disorders. While many aspects of this health disparity remain poorly understood, our results support the need to further study the microbiome as a contributing factor. As the field of microbiome research transitions to therapeutic interventions, it raises concerns that the continued exclusion and lack of participation of American Indian communities in these studies will further exacerbate health disparities.

IsoalloLCA exerted potent antimicrobial effects against Gram-positive (but not Gram-negative) multidrug-resistant pathogens, including Clostridioides difficile and Enterococcus faecium.

We observe microbiome-cytokine interaction patterns that are stimulus specific, cytokine specific, and cytokine and stimulus specific. Validation of two predicted host-microbial interactions reveal that TNFα and IFNγ production are associated with specific microbial metabolic pathways: palmitoleic acid metabolism and tryptophan degradation to tryptophol. Besides providing a resource of predicted microbially derived mediators that influence immune phenotypes in response to common microorganisms, these data can help to define principles for understanding disease susceptibility.

This overlap is thought to be driven by analogous dietary triggers; however, the ecological and functional bases of this similarity are not fully understood. To start addressing this issue, fecal metagenomes of BaAka hunter-gatherers and traditional Bantu agriculturalists from the Central African Republic were profiled and compared with those of a sympatric western lowland gorilla group (<i>Gorilla</i> <i>gorilla gorilla</i>) across two seasons of variable dietary intake. Results show that gorilla gut microbiomes shared similar functional traits with each human group, depending on seasonal dietary behavior. Specifically, parallel microbiome traits were observed between hunter-gatherers and gorillas when the latter consumed more structural polysaccharides during dry seasons, while small-scale agriculturalist and gorilla microbiomes showed significant functional overlap when gorillas consumed more seasonal ripe fruit during wet seasons. Notably, dominance of microbial transporters, transduction systems, and gut xenobiotic metabolism was observed in association with traditional agriculture and energy-dense diets in gorillas at the expense of a functional microbiome repertoire capable of metabolizing more complex polysaccharides. Differential abundance of bacterial taxa that typically distinguish traditional from industrialized human populations (e.g., <i>Prevotella</i> spp.) was also recapitulated in the human and gorilla groups studied, possibly reflecting the degree of polysaccharide complexity included in each group's dietary niche. These results show conserved functional gut microbiome adaptations to analogous diets in small-scale human populations and nonhuman primates, highlighting the role of plant dietary polysaccharides and diverse environmental exposures in this convergence.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The results of this study highlight parallel gut microbiome traits in human and nonhuman primates, depending on subsistence strategy. Although these similarities have been reported before, the functional and ecological bases of this convergence are not fully understood. Here, we show that this parallelism is, in part, likely modulated by the complexity of plant carbohydrates consumed and by exposures to diverse xenobiotics of natural and artificial origin. Furthermore, we discuss how divergence from these parallel microbiome traits is typically associated with adverse health outcomes in human populations living under culturally westernized subsistence patterns. This is important information as we trace the specific dietary and environmental triggers associated with the loss and gain of microbial functions as humans adapt to various dietary niches.",mSystems,5,6,,10.1128/mSystems.00815-20,PMC7762792,Journal Article,,gorillas; gut microbiome; hunter-gatherers; metagenomics; traditional agriculturalists,"Department of Animal Science, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA.; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic petrzelkova@ivb.cz gomeza@umn.edu.; Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceske Budejovice, Brno, Czech Republic.; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina, USA.; WWF-CAR, Bangui, Central African Republic.; Carl Woese Institute of Genomic Biology, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, USA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, USA.; Carl Woese Institute of Genomic Biology, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, USA.; Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, USA.; J.

Although the success of FMT requires donor bacteria to engraft in the patient's gut, the forces governing engraftment in humans are unknown. Here we use an ongoing clinical experiment, the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, to uncover the rules of engraftment in humans. We built a statistical model that predicts which bacterial species will engraft in a given host, and developed Strain Finder, a method to infer strain genotypes and track them over time.

We collected diarrheal stools from 49 inpatients (18 of whom tested positive for CDI) under stringent inclusion criteria. We utilized a tiered sequencing approach to identify enriched bacterial and fungal taxa, using 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with matched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics performed on a subset of the population. Distinct bacterial and fungal compositions distinguished CDI-positive and -negative patients, with the greatest differentiation between the cohorts observed based on bacterial metatranscriptomics. Bipartite network analyses demonstrated that <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> taxa shared a strong positive relationship in CDI patients and together formed negative cooccurring relationships with several bacterial taxa, including the <i>Oscillospira</i>, <i>Comamonadaceae</i>, <i>Microbacteriaceae</i>, and <i>Cytophagaceae</i> Metatranscriptomics revealed enriched pathways in CDI patients associated with biofilm production primarily driven by <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>, quorum-sensing proteins, and two-component systems related to functions such as osmotic regulation, linoleic acid metabolism, and flagellar assembly. Differential expression of functional pathways unveiled a mechanism by which the causal dysbiosis of CDI may self-perpetuate, potentially contributing to treatment failures.

It is hypothesized that a disrupted bacterial and viral gut microbiota is a part of the pathogenesis mediating disease impact through an altered gut microbiota-brain axis. The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis and to associate it with disease variables, as the etiology of the disease remains only partially known. Here, in a case-control setting involving 148 Danish cases with multiple sclerosis and 148 matched healthy control subjects, we performed shotgun sequencing of fecal microbial DNA and associated bacterial and viral microbiota findings with plasma cytokines, blood cell gene expression profiles, and disease activity. We found 61 bacterial species that were differentially abundant when comparing all multiple sclerosis cases with healthy controls, among which 31 species were enriched in cases. A cluster of inflammation markers composed of blood leukocytes, CRP, and blood cell gene expression of IL17A and IL6 was positively associated with a cluster of multiple sclerosis-related species. Bacterial species that were more abundant in cases with disease-active treatment-naïve multiple sclerosis were positively linked to a group of plasma cytokines including IL-22, IL-17A, IFN-β, IL-33, and TNF-α. The bacterial species richness of treatment-naïve multiple sclerosis cases was associated with number of relapses over a follow-up period of 2 years. However, in non-disease-active cases, we identified two bacterial species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens, whose absolute abundance was enriched. These bacteria are known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites including butyrate and urolithin. In addition, cases with multiple sclerosis had a higher viral species diversity and a higher abundance of Caudovirales bacteriophages. Considerable aberrations are present in the gut microbiota of patients with multiple sclerosis that are directly associated with blood biomarkers of inflammation, and in treatment-naïve cases bacterial richness is positively associated with disease activity. Yet, the finding of two symbiotic bacterial species in non-disease-active cases that produce favorable immune-modulating compounds provides a rationale for testing these bacteria as adjunct therapeutics in future clinical trials.",Genome medicine,15,1,1,10.1186/s13073-022-01148-1,PMC9814178,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Young Adult; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Inflammation; Microbiota; Feces; Bacteria; Cytokines,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens; Gut microbiota; Multiple sclerosis; Shotgun sequencing,"Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, MGP, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.; Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, 2600, Glostrup, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, MGP, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.; Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, MGP, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.; Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, MGP, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, 2600, Glostrup, Denmark.; Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg University Hospital, 2400, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Experimental and Clinical Research Center, A Cooperation of Charité-Universitätsmedizin and the Max-Delbrück Center, 10117, Berlin, Germany.; Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), 13125, Berlin, Germany.; Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 10117, Berlin, Germany.; DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Berlin, 10785, Berlin, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Medicine, Rønne Hospital, 3700, Bornholm, Denmark.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, 2800, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.; Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, 2600, Glostrup, Denmark.; Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, 2600, Glostrup, Denmark.; Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, MGP, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.; Department of Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, WC1N 3RX, UK.; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Copenhagen, 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark. oluf@sund.ku.dk.; Center for Clinical Metabolic Research, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, 2900, Copenhagen, Denmark. oluf@sund.ku.dk.",,2025-03-25

The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis. In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument. SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (ρ = 0.34, <i>q</i> ≤ .1). Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome. Cognitive function of patients with SCZ is associated with the potential for gut bacterial biosynthesis of tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, suggesting that gut microbiota might be an intervention target for alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ.",Biological psychiatry global open science,3,2,283-291,10.1016/j.bpsgos.2022.01.009,PMC10140391,Journal Article,,Case-control study;

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT. Fecal samples were collected from 22 patients with RCDI before and after FMT and their corresponding healthy donors. Total DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The Cosmos-ID analysis platform was used for taxonomic assignment of sequences and calculation of the relative abundance (RA) of bacterial species and strains. From these data, the total number of bacterial strains (BSI), Shannon diversity index, dysbiosis index (DI), and bacterial engraftment factor, were calculated for each strain. A marked reduction (p<0·0001) in the RA of total and specific bacterial strains, especially from phylum Firmicutes, was observed in RCDI patients prior to FMT. This change was associated with an increase in the DI (p<0·0001) and in pathobiont bacterial strains from phylum Proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae UCI 34. BSI was significantly lower in this group of patients as compared to healthy donors and correlated with the Shannon Index. (p<0·0001).

Understanding these variations is needed for comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings from a previously published 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. This demonstrated that within the same sample set, most, but not all taxonomic associations were seen with both methods. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in a recently published French metagenomics dataset, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In total, colorectal cancer status in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified in the French study. More within and between population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease associations that can be reproduced despite these variations. Future studies should have larger sample sizes or pool data across studies to have sufficient power to detect associations that are reproducible and significant after correction for multiple testing.",PloS one,11,5,e0155362,10.1371/journal.pone.0155362,PMC4865240,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Case-Control Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; District of Columbia; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.; Clinical Cooperation Unit Applied Tumor Biology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Genomics Core Facility, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Max Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Bioinformatics Biocenter, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.",,2025-03-25

A group of microbial species enriched in ESRD correlates tightly to patient clinical variables and encode functions involved in toxin and secondary bile acids synthesis; the relative abundance of the microbial functions correlates with the serum or faecal concentrations of these metabolites. Microbiota from patients transplanted to renal injured germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated rats induce higher production of serum uraemic toxins and aggravated renal fibrosis and oxidative stress more than microbiota from controls. Two of the species, <i>Eggerthella lenta</i> and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, increase uraemic toxins production and promote renal disease development in a CKD rat model. A probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> decreases abundance of these species, reduces levels of toxins and the severity of the disease in rats.

While the gut is a known reservoir for uropathogenic bacteria, the role of the microbiota in rUTI remains unclear. We conducted a year-long study of women with (n = 15) and without (n = 16) history of rUTI, from whom we collected urine, blood and monthly faecal samples for metagenomic and transcriptomic interrogation. During the study 24 UTIs were reported, with additional samples collected during and after infection. The gut microbiome of individuals with a history of rUTI was significantly depleted in microbial richness and butyrate-producing bacteria compared with controls, reminiscent of other inflammatory conditions. However, Escherichia coli gut and bladder populations were comparable between cohorts in both relative abundance and phylogroup. Transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed expression profiles indicative of differential systemic immunity between cohorts.

The reasons for longevity in this isolated region are currently unknown. Gut microbiota may hold a clue. To explore the role gut microbiota may play in healthy aging and longevity, we used metagenomic sequencing to determine the compositional and functional differences in gut microbiota associated with populations of different ages in Sardinia. Our data revealed that the gut microbiota of both young and elderly Sardinians shared similar taxonomic and functional profiles. A different pattern was found in centenarians. Within the centenarian group, the gut microbiota was correlated with the functional independence measurement of the host. Centenarians had a higher diversity of core microbiota species and microbial genes than those in the young and elderly. We found that the gut microbiota in Sardinian centenarians displayed a rearranged taxonomic pattern compared with those of the young and elderly, featured by depletion of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> and <i>Eubacterium rectale</i> and enriched for <i>Methanobrevibacter smithii</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> Moreover, functional analysis revealed that the microbiota in centenarians had high capacity for central metabolism, especially glycolysis and fermentation to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), although the gut microbiota in centenarians was low in genes encoding enzymes involved in degradation of carbohydrates, including fibers and galactose.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The gut microbiota has been proposed as a promising determinant for human health. Centenarians as a model for extreme aging may help us understand the correlation of gut microbiota with healthy aging and longevity. Here we confirmed that centenarians had microbiota elements usually associated with benefits to health. Our finding of a high capacity of glycolysis and related SCFA production represented a healthy microbiome and environment that is regarded as beneficial for host gut epithelium. The low abundance of genes encoding components of pathways involved in carbohydrate degradation was also found in the gut microbiota of Sardinian centenarians and is often associated with poor gut health.

In this study, we investigated the association of gut microbiome composition with BD as well as its possible roles in the development of this disease. Fecal and saliva samples were collected from 32 active BD patients and 74 healthy controls. DNA extracted from fecal samples was subjected to metagenomic analysis, whereas DNA extracted from saliva samples was subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results were used to compare the composition and biological function of the microbiome between patients and healthy controls. Lastly, transplantation of pooled fecal samples from active BD patients into B10RIII mice undergoing experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was performed to determine the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and BD. Fecal samples from active BD patients were shown to be enriched in Bilophila spp., a sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and several opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Parabacteroides spp. and Paraprevotella spp.) along with a lower level of butyrate-producing bacteria (BPB) Clostridium spp. and methanogens (Methanoculleus spp. Methanomethylophilus spp.). Analysis of microbial functions revealed that capsular polysaccharide transport system, oxidation-reduction process, type III, and type IV secretion systems were also increased in active BD patients. Network analysis showed that the BD-enriched SRB and opportunistic pathogens were positively correlated with each other, but they were negatively associated with the BPB and methanogens. Animal experiments revealed that fecal microbiota transplantation with feces from BD patients significantly exacerbated EAU activity and increased the production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-17 and IFN-γ.

Moreover, this perturbed composition exhibited stratification with disease severity concordant with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers such as C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses. Furthermore, the gut microbiota dysbiosis after disease resolution could contribute to persistent symptoms, highlighting a need to understand how gut microorganisms are involved in inflammation and COVID-19.",Gut,70,4,698-706,10.1136/gutjnl-2020-323020,PMC7804842,"Journal Article;

We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls. Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC. We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable clinically relevant technology.

Here, we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.",Molecular systems biology,10,11,766,10.15252/msb.20145645,PMC4299606,"Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Case-Control Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Feces; Humans; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Molecular Typing; Occult Blood; Sensitivity and Specificity,cancer screening; colorectal cancer; fecal biomarkers; human gut microbiome; metagenomics,"Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Gastroenterology and LIC-EA4393-EC2M3, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Clinical Cooperation Unit Applied Tumor Biology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology and LIC-EA4393-EC2M3, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Surgery, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Genomics Core Facility, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Radiology, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Medical Oncology, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Department of Pathology and LIC-EA4393-EC2M3, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France.; Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan.; Genomics Core Facility, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Genomics Core Facility, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Clinical Cooperation Unit Applied Tumor Biology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Clinical Cooperation Unit Applied Tumor Biology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology and LIC-EA4393-EC2M3, APHP and UPEC Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France iradj.sobhani@hmn.aphp.fr bork@embl.de.; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), University Hospital Heidelberg and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany Max Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany iradj.sobhani@hmn.aphp.fr bork@embl.de.",,2025-03-25

Our objective is to advance toward a holistic understanding of the gut ecosystem and its functional capacity in such patients, which is still lacking. Herein, we explore the gut microbiome of 378 hemodialytic ESRD patients and 290 healthy volunteers from two independent cohorts via deep metagenomic sequencing and metagenome-assembled-genome-based characterization of their feces. Our findings reveal fundamental alterations in the ESRD microbiome, characterized by a panel of 348 differentially abundant species, including ESRD-elevated representatives of Blautia spp., Dorea spp., and Eggerthellaceae, and ESRD-depleted Prevotella and Roseburia species. Through functional annotation of the ESRD-associated species, we uncover various taxon-specific functions linked to the disease, such as antimicrobial resistance, aromatic compound degradation, and biosynthesis of small bioactive molecules. Additionally, we show that the gut microbial composition can be utilized to predict serum uremic toxin concentrations, and based on this, we identify the key toxin-contributing species. Furthermore, our investigation extended to 47 additional non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, revealing a significant correlation between the abundance of ESRD-associated microbial signatures and CKD progression.

Levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophile granulocytes (NE), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were higher in all patients after surgery. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, were also higher after surgery. A metagenome analysis revealed that levels of Oscillibacter, Anaerotruncus, Alistipes, and Clostridium difficile were higher after the operation. The abundance of functional genes, such as the spermidine/putrescine transport system permease protein, the flagellar motor switch protein, and branched-chain amino acid transport system proteins, was also higher post-surgery.

The composition and functional capacity of gut microbiota associated with breast cancer have not been studied systematically. We performed a comprehensive shotgun metagenomic analysis of 18 premenopausal breast cancer patients, 25 premenopausal healthy controls, 44 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, and 46 postmenopausal healthy controls. Microbial diversity was higher in breast cancer patients than in controls. Relative species abundance in gut microbiota did not differ significantly between premenopausal breast cancer patients and premenopausal controls. In contrast, relative abundance of 45 species differed significantly between postmenopausal patients and postmenopausal controls: 38 species were enriched in postmenopausal patients, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp_1_1_55, Prevotella amnii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Actinomyces sp. HPA0247, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Erwinia amylovora, and 7 species were less abundant in postmenopausal patients, including Eubacterium eligens and Lactobacillus vaginalis. Acinetobacter radioresistens and Enterococcus gallinarum were positively but weakly associated with expression of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; Shewanella putrefaciens and Erwinia amylovora were positively but weakly associated with estradiol levels. Actinomyces sp. HPA0247 negatively but weakly correlated with CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers. Further characterization of metagenome functional capacity indicated that the gut metagenomes of postmenopausal breast cancer patients were enriched in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, iron complex transport system, PTS system, secretion system, and beta-oxidation.

Recent studies suggest that the composition of the intestinal microbiome is associated with metabolic diseases through modulation of inflammation and host metabolism. To investigate whether compositional and functional alterations of the intestinal microbiome are associated with AMD, we sequenced the gut metagenomes of patients with AMD and controls. The genera Anaerotruncus and Oscillibacter as well as Ruminococcus torques and Eubacterium ventriosum were relatively enriched in patients with AMD, whereas Bacteroides eggerthii was enriched in controls. Patient's intestinal microbiomes were enriched in genes of the L-alanine fermentation, glutamate degradation and arginine biosynthesis pathways and decreased in genes of the fatty acid elongation pathway.

As cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular has been associated with compositional alterations in the gut microbiome, we investigated this association in patients with clinically confirmed non-arteritic RAO compared to age- and sex-matched controls. On the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased in patients with RAO compared to controls, whereas the opposite applied for the phylum of Proteobacteria. Several genera and species such as Actinobacter, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides stercoris, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were relatively enriched in patients with RAO, whereas others such as Odoribacter, Parasutterella or Lachnospiraceae were significantly lower. Patient's gut microbiomes were enriched in genes of the cholesterol metabolism pathway. The gut derived, pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was significantly higher in patients with RAO compared to controls (p = 0.023) and a negative correlation between relative abundances of genera Parasutterella and Lachnospiraceae and TMAO levels and a positive correlation between relative abundance of genus Akkermansia and TMAO levels was found in study subjects. Our findings proposes that RAO is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome and with elevated TMAO levels, suggesting that RAO could be targeted by microbiome-altering interventions.",Scientific reports,9,1,15303,10.1038/s41598-019-51698-5,PMC6814871,Journal Article,"Actinobacteria; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; Faecalibacterium; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Methylamines; Retinal Artery Occlusion; Risk Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence",,"Department of Ophthalmology, Inselspital, Freiburgstrasse, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland. denise.zysset@insel.ch.; Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland. denise.zysset@insel.ch.; Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Baltzerstrasse 6, CH-3012, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Ophthalmology, Inselspital, Freiburgstrasse, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.; Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, Tellstrasse 25, CH-5001, Aarau, Switzerland.; Graduate School for Cellular & Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Freiestrasse 1, CH-3012, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 4, CH-8093, Zürich, Switzerland.; Department of Ophthalmology, Inselspital, Freiburgstrasse, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Ophthalmology, Inselspital, Freiburgstrasse, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.",,2025-03-25
