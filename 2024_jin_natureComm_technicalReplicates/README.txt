Look at Supplementary Data 8 for counts, and scale. Note that each sample has three technical replicates to check reproducibility. 

Group(condition) can be identified by sample name. How to interpret sample name;
- First two letter indicates group; 1) three 6-week old mice (CEa, CEb, CEc); maintained by balanced diet for full life span, 2) four 8-week-old (VSa, VSb, VSc, VSd), 3) four mice (VDa, VDb, Vdc, VDd). 
- Super script 'dist' and 'prox' indicates location of cecum it was collected (distal and proximal, Fig 1b). 
- Number indicates technical replicates (i.e., CEa^dist1, CEa^dist2, CEa^dist3 are the three technical replicates from the same mice collected at same cecum location). 

Check Supplementary Table 5 in 'Supplementary Information file' for more detailed description of names.
