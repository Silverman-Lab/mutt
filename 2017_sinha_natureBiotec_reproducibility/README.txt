MBQC project - it aims to evaluate methods for measuring human microbiome (protocols for handling human microbiome samples and computational pipelines for microbial data processing). The goal is helping context-dependent protocol choices by identifying the relative effect sizes of individual variables.

The data include results sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed based on 9 bioinformatics protocols.

Supplementary Datasets can be found in the paper ; https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3981#Sec26


Supplementary Data set 1
Extended literature review and categorization of microbiome protocol studies. (XLSX 117 kb)

Supplementary Data set 2
Handling protocol variables recorded during the MBQC-base. (XLSX 25 kb)

Supplementary Data set 3
Bioinformatics protocol variable reporting. (XLSX 24 kb)

Supplementary Data set 4
Handling protocol variables curated from the MBQC-base. (XLSX 16 kb)

Supplementary Data set 5
Raw read counts per sample. (XLSX 41 kb)
Note ; 'Blinded sample ID' matches with row names in Supplementary Dataset 6.

Supplementary Data set 6
MBQC-base OTU table. (ZIP 14543 kb)
Note ; It has both metadata and OTU counts. 
Note ; Check if this identical to mbqc_integrated_otus.tsv retrieved from mbqc_org_files
Note ; nt_count seems to be the scale.

Supplementary Data set 7
Alpha and beta diversities stratified by sample type within and between 175 handling and bioinformatics laboratories. (ZIP 7139 kb)

Supplementary Data set 8
Beta-diversity divergence from artificial community positive controls; 181 stratified by handling and bioinformatics laboratories. (TXT 2 kb)

Seems like they provide the same information as supplementary datasets, but will need to check
