"Concentration" is the copies/uL readout from the digital PCR machine. "Corrected Concentration" is the "Concentration" column multiplied by whatever sample dilution was used before digital PCR.

"_Duo" means the sample was from the duodenum and "_Sal" means the samples was from saliva. These annotations are only in the paired sheet because the other sheet just has duodenum samples. The sample number is a patient ID number that is unique.
