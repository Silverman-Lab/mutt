Piglet feeding trial A with tylosin application
Four weeks old female pigs obtained from the Mörsdorfer Agrar GmbH (Mörsdorf, Thuringia, Germany) were maintained in the animal facility of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (Jena, Germany) in separate pens. After 2 weeks of acclimatization, piglets (n = 2 per group in pre-trial, n = 4 per group in main trial, 12 animals in total, 10.77 ± 1.39 kg live weight) were fed about 5 g of either pure peanut butter (Netto American Style, Netto Marken-Discount Stiftung & Co. KG, Maxhütte-Haidhof, Germany) or peanut butter supplemented with tylosin tartrate (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) at a concentration of 10 mg/kg bodyweight per piglet. Each feeding was done twice in an interval of 24 h. Individual faecal samples were collected before (d0) and 30 h (d1), 48 h (d2), 72 h (d3), and 96 h (d4) after antibiotic treatment. Samples were homogenized, and aliquots were stored either at room temperature (RT) in 600 μL DNA stabilization solution (INVITEK Molecular, Berlin, Germany) for sequencing, or at −20°C without additives.

Piglet feeding trial B with tulathromycin application
Eighty weaned barrows (6.39 ± 1.1 kg live weight) were group-housed (four piglets/pen) and equally assigned to one of four diets with graded copper levels (five pens/diet) during 5 weeks of rearing. At the end of the fourth experimental week, piglets of each dietary group were subdivided into half and were subjected to intramuscular injection of the antibiotic (DRAXXIN® Zoetis, 2.5 mg tulathromycin/kg BW) or a placebo (0.9% NaCl). Individual faecal samples obtained via manual rectal stimulation were collected directly before and 24 h after the respective injection. Faecal material was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and stored at −80°C until further processing. Six piglets (antibiotic-treated individuals) of the dietary groups with 150 mg Cu/kg feed were chosen for further analysis in this study for total bacterial counts and sequencing.

Sequencing and raw read processing
Isolation of total DNA and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was carried out at the Core Facility Microbiome of the Technical University of Munich (Freising, Germany) as described previously (Reitmeier et al., 2020) with slight modifications. Briefly, DNA was isolated using a MaxWell (Promega, Walldorf, Germany) after bead-beating and used in a 2-step PCR to generate sequencing libraries. The first PCR used primers specific for the V3 and V4 regions (i.e., 341F, CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG; 785R, GAC TAC HVG GGT ATC TAA TCC) that contain an overhang for the subsequent PCR for sample barcoding. Cleaned libraries were sequenced PE300 on a MiSeq (Illumina). Spike-in of synthetic full-length 16S rRNA genes was done as described by Tourlousse et al. (2018, 2017). Here, 6 ng of spike DNA, consisting of an equimolar mixture of 13 linearized plasmids, each of which contains an artificial 16S rRNA gene, was added to 600 μL of the faeces-stabilizer mix. In each artificial “gene”, the invariant regions of the 16S rRNA were left untouched, while the variable regions were swapped with artificial sequences. Thus, spike reads are clearly distinguishable from true bacterial reads in analysis. Sample weight (i.e., gram of faecal material) was recorded in order to obtain 16S rRNA GCN per gram sample.

Raw reads were processed with pipeline DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016). Sequences were demultiplexed and filtered, and amplicons with an expected error > 2 were excluded. To limit the analysis of regions with higher error values, reads were trimmed to sequence lengths of 250 bp and 200 bp, respectively, for forward and reverse reads. Remaining reads were merged to paired end reads. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were clustered at 97% sequence identity, and their sample-wise abundances were calculated after removing substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomies were assigned at 80% confidence level by considering results from both the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (Wang et al., 2007) and the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA; v1.2.11) (Pruesse et al., 2012). Taxon names were verified manually in accordance to the nomenclature defined by the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) (Parte, 2013; Parte, 2018; Parte et al., 2020; Euzéby, 1997).

16S rRNA GCN correction and synthetic spike-in
ASVs were analysed using parts of the PICRUSt2 pipeline (Douglas et al., 2020) as follows. HMMER version v3.3.21 places ASVs, EPA-ng (Barbera et al., 2018) determined the optimal position of these ASVs in a reference phylogeny, and GAPPA (Czech and Stamatakis, 2019) outputs a new tree incorporating ASV placements. This adjusted reference phylogeny allowed for the prediction of 16S rRNA GCN. The IMNGS output ASVs tables were corrected within the PICRUSt2 pipeline by dividing the original read counts by the predicted GCN.

To obtain a more intuitive comparability of both methods, we harmonized absolute abundances obtained by a flow cytometry method, FACS, and the spike-in approach as follows. Since the spike-in method gives only relative numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies between samples, cell counts of piglet 7 determined by FACS on day 0 were used as a reference. Subsequently, read counts for the spikes of this sample were scaled to the cell numbers within this sample using an arbitrary factor. The factor was chosen such that the relative amount of spike in this sample could be converted into the cell number found by FACS. The other samples gave relative numbers of gene copies that were multiplied by this factor in order to calculate cell number equivalents.
