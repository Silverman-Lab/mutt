Additional file 1: Table S1:
Species-specific and total 16S rDNA quantitative realtime-PCR measurements. (XLSX 13 kb)
Has total 16s rDNA copies per sample (sample65 ~ sample102 : mice)

Additional file 2: Table S2:
Design of dilution experiment. (XLSX 16 kb)
Has information about amount of spiked 16S rRNA copies per sample

Additional file 3: Table S3:
Pools of bacterial mock communities containing S. ruber, A. acidiphilus and R. radiobacter. (XLSX 13 kb)
Has information about the amount of three bacteria spiked into each pool.

Additional file 7:
Dilution experiment mapping file as used for reproduction. (TXT 3 kb)
Note : sample ID is MID01 - MID40. Check Additional file 11 to check mapping to sample(65-102)

Additional file 8:
ASCT experiment mapping file as used for reproduction. (TXT 1 kb)
SampleID : MID26-43, but don't confuse this with samples from Additional file 7. Additional file 8 is human data (ASCT experiment) and Additional file 7 is mice data (dilution experiment).

Additional file 11:
Total 16S rDNA qRT-PCR measurements as used for reproduction. (CSV 1 kb)
Note : this data matches with total 16S rDNA copies from Additional file 1. Also gives mapping to Sample (65-102) and SampleID (MID1-MID40) used in dilution experiment. Sample 87 and 88 are missing from this mapping.
