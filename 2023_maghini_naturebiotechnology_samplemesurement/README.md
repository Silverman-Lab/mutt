 Metadata can obtain from ID and representation of each ID can be informed from below reponse.

Clarification got from cooresponding author:

 + D## = the donor number.
 + N = no preservative
 + O = Omni preservative
 + Z = Zymo preservative
 + F = Frozen (-80C) right away
 + H = hot temperature (40C)
 + R = room temperature (23C)
 + R1 = replicate 1
 + R2 = replicate 2
 + R3 = replicate 3
 + Note: In the GEE model, no other covariates was included in the analysis. (Quto "No covariates, it was really the simplest thing. As we say in the stats methods section, we used an ""unadjusted regression model with fixed effects for the seven conditions and an exchangeable correlation structure between the participant-level clusters to account for repeat measurements."  So, for instance, if we were modeling the log of the total abundance, the model would have just been log_total_abundance ~ C(Sample_Type).")
