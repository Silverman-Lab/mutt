paper is behind paywall so included here in repo. Assessed the distribution of ( 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-311004 ) 106 previously amplicon-sequenced primary sclerosing cholangitis and/or inflammatory bowel disease (PSC/IBD) faecal samples - (PSC n=18, Crohn’s disease (CD) n=29, ulcerative colitis (UC) n=13, PSC–CD n=20 and PSC–UC n=26) 10 against
a background of non-disease-associated microbiome variation as
observed in the Flemish Gut Flora Project cohort (FGFP; n=1,120). On the basis of genus-level inter-individual differences in microbiome composition, the combined patient group was observed to separate from a set of 66 FGFP
healthy controls (mHCs) 10 that were matched by age, gender and
body mass index with PSC or PSC–IBD diagnosed individuals. 224 individuals with UC or CD (Chron's Disease) were then independently recruited as a validation cohort.
