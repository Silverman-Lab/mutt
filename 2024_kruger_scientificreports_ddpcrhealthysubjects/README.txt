Participants collected faecal samples on three consecutive days, or alternatively at three timepoints as close as possible to each other within one week. 
All faecal sample analyses from the same individual for all measurements were performed within the same batch. 10 replicates of 1–2 gram faeces were made from a pooled sample of 15 gram faeces obtained from all ten participants. Afterwards, five replicates were then processed by hammering only, while five replicates were both hammered and mill-homogenised. water content and ph were measured, protein biomarkers through ELISA, and SCFA/BCFAs were measured via GC-MS, also performed untargeted metabolomics through LC-MS, and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS.


Six quality controls (QC), which consisted of a pool of the faecal samples from the participants, were analysed to ensure precision and stability of the LC-MS machine during the whole process of injection. QC samples were injected every after 10 sample injections and was used to assess chromatographic drift and instrumental errors.
