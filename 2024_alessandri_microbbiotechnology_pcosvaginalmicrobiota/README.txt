10 subjects: faecal and vaginal samples were collected from 10 healthy women who had not taken prebiotics, probiotics or drugs during the 3 months prior to sample collection.Faecal samples were inoculated in a human gut environment‐simulating growth medium, based on a previously described composition (Fehlbaum et al., 2015; Macfarlane et al., 1998).The same protocol was used for the cultivation of vaginal samples. However, in this case, a culture medium mimicking the human vaginal environment, that is, the simulated vaginal fluid, with a pH adjusted to 4.5, as previously described (Pan et al., 2019), was employed. Faecal and vaginal samples were cultivated for 19 and 24 h, respectively, under anaerobic conditions at 37°C. Furthermore, for each of the two matrices, samples were cultured in the presence and absence of 2% α‐LA.

Ten patients with clinical signs of PCOS were enrolled for the in vivo pilot study at Agunco Obstetric and Gynecologic Centre (Rome, Italy). evaluate the possible impact of orally administrated α‐LA on vaginal microbiota in such patients, all the women underwent a 30‐day oral administration of α‐LA (300 mg/twice a day), and two vaginal swabs were collected from each patient: one before (baseline—T0) and one after (T1) α‐LA administration.
