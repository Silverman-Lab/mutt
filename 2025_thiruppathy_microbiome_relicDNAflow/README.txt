Absolute bacterial quantification (bacteria/cm2) was measured using flow cytometry on raw (total bacteria) and PMA-treated (live bacteria only) samples (Table S3). Analysis included samples meeting sequencing and flow cytometry gating criteria (n = 135: 67 PMA treated, 68 untreated).

(E) =  ((A/B)x(C/D))
(H) = (E) x (G) / (F)
