Source data 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, 4-1, 4-2 are available.
Note that source data 1-3, 2-1, 4-1, 4-2 are longitudinal. Details can be found below. 

parse_2019_contijoch_eLife_16S will return list with five elements where each element is a list that includes scale, count, metadata, and taxonomy for each source data based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

parse_2019_contijoch_eLife_metagenomic is work in progress. It will have data collected by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
