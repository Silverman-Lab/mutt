Authors developed a spike-in control method for sample tracking and detection of cross-contamination in microbiome community analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing across samples from different sources -- soil and sewage. 

Two different STMs were added to DNA extracted from two contrasting microbiota, namely from sewage (DNA spiked with stm88) and soil (DNA spiked with stm89). Artificially contaminated samples were then prepared by mixing both STM-tagged samples in varying ratios, from 50% to 0.01% of soil DNA diluted in sewage DNA.
